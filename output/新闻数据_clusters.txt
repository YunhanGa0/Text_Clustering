Two icons converge in Netflix's latest crime noir series as one of the South Korea's most widely beloved webtoons gets the live-action treatment with fan-favourite actor So Ji-sub stepping into the lead role.
  Titled Mercy For None, the series follows Ki-joon (So), a former gangster who resurfaces after an 11-year disappearance to avenge his brother’s death. Adapted from the wildly popular Naver Webtoon of the same name, which ran from 2020 to 2021, the series builds on the source material’s reputation as one of South Korea’s most anticipated noir-action titles this year.
  So’s casting as Ki-joon was a dream come true for longtime fans of the original comic, who had long envisioned him as the perfect fit for the ruthless fighter, according to the series' director.
  So is known for his performances in hit K-dramas such as I’m Sorry, I Love You and Master’s Sun. — So Ji-sub/Instagram
  “So Ji-sub was the casting that fans of the original webtoon wanted most for the live-action adaptation. I was really glad that he agreed to take the role,” said director Choi Seong-eun at a press conference in Seoul recently.
  “Even I wasn’t sure at first what kind of image or expression that actor would bring to the character Ki-joon. But on the first day I met him, I felt that he would be able to convey Ki-joon’s emotions well. I was given the opportunity to create freely in a rich environment with truly great ingredients.”
  Known for his performances in past hit dramas such as I’m Sorry, I Love You (2004) and Master’s Sun (2013), So returns to the action genre for the first time in over a decade, following his role in the 2012 feature A Company Man.Mercy For None also marks his debut in an original series for a streamer.
  The series is adapted from the wildly popular Naver Webtoon of the same name, which ran from 2020 to 2021.
  Discussing the action-driven narrative, So explained his approach to the role's physicality.
  “The director told us not to include unnecessary action. He said it would be better not to throw in action just for the sake of it during transitional scenes. "When it comes to revenge, are we going to subdue these people or punish them? There’s a difference, and we tried to make that distinction,” So, 47, said.
  “For each character, I thought of the action as a form of dialogue spoken through the body. "The director said it would be great if the characters’ energy and emotional flow could be felt when they fight," the actor explained. "He also said the action should have a narrative arc —beginning, development, twist and conclusion. "He wanted the intensity of the action to build gradually and reach a climax. "We talked about a lot of things beyond that too, and fortunately, I think all of that was well reflected in the final piece,” So added.
  Director Choi emphasised that the emotional stakes were central to staging the combat.
  “For the action scenes as well, Ki-joon’s emotions were the most important. If the emotions weren’t convincing, it could come across as just a physical clash. I directed it so that the collision of emotions would manifest as action.” – The Korea Herald/Asia News Network
  Mercy For None is available on Netflix.

WASHINGTON, June 14 (Reuters) -- Authorities on Saturday asked residents of two Minneapolis suburbs to stay indoors as they searched for a suspect posing as a police officer who shot two Democratic state lawmakers and their spouses in their homes, according to local media reports.
  Those targeted in the pre-dawn attacks were identified in the reports as state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, of Champlin, and state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, of Brooklyn Park.
  The conditions of the victims were not immediately known.
  Amy Klobuchar, one of Minnesota's US senators, confirmed the identities of the victims of the "stunning act of violence" in a post on X, saying her prayers "are with the Hortman and Hoffman families. Both legislators are close friends and devoted to their families and public service."
  Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will speak to reporters shortly to "address violence targeted at legislators," his office said.
  Walz said in a post on X that he was "briefed this morning on an ongoing situation involving targeted shootings in Champlin and Brooklyn Park. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety and local law enforcement are on the scene."
  In a later post, Walz said he had activated Minnesota's Emergency Operations Centre and was providing the police in the two suburbs "the full resources" of the state.

MINNEAPOLIS
:
A gunman posing as a police officer killed a senior Democratic state assemblyman and her husband yesterday in an apparent “politically motivated assassination”, and wounded a second lawmaker and his spouse, said Minnesota governor Tim Walz and law enforcement officials.
A major search backed by the FBI was underway for the suspect, who fled on foot after firing at police and abandoning a vehicle in which officers found a “manifesto” and a list of other legislators and officials, law enforcement officials said.
The suspect was identified as 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension superintendent Drew Evans told a news briefing.
Boelter should be considered “armed and dangerous” and is believed to still be in the Minneapolis-St Paul area, Evans said, adding that it was too soon to determine a motive.
The suspect had links to evangelical ministries and claimed to be a security expert with experience in the Gaza Strip and Africa, according to his online postings and public records reviewed by Reuters.
Boelter also described himself online as a former employee of food service companies.
Evans said investigators were aware of similar reports of his connections and would be exploring them.
The list found in the abandoned vehicle that looked similar to a police SUV contained about 70 names, including abortion providers, and lawmakers in Minnesota and other states, CNN reported, citing law enforcement sources.
ABC News, also citing law enforcement officials, said the list included dozens of Minnesota Democrats including Walz, US representative Ilhan Omar, senator Tina Smith and Minnesota attorney-general Keith Ellison.
The killings of Melissa Hortman, a former assembly speaker and her husband, Mark, prompted reactions of shock and horror from Republican and Democratic politicians across the country and calls for dialling back increasingly divisive political rhetoric.
The shootings come on the heels of a heated hearing in congress on Thursday in which Walz and two other Democratic governors defended their states’ policies to maintain sanctuary for undocumented immigrants, drawing attacks from Republicans who support Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
Minnesota state patrol chief colonel Christina Bogojevic said that police found flyers in the suspect’s vehicle with “No Kings” printed on them, but he had no direct links to the thousands of nationwide “No Kings” protests against President Donald Trump’s policies taking place today.
The protests were timed to counter Trump’s long-sought military parade in Washington.
The organising No Kings Coalition cancelled all protests in Minnesota, citing a shelter-in-place order and the suspect’s at-large status.
Trump said he was briefed on the “terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers”.
“Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!” Trump said in a statement.

Hortman and her husband were shot dead in their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park, Walz said.
The Minneapolis suburb is located in the northern part of Hennepin County, a Democratic stronghold in a state where Republicans have made gains in recent years.
Prior to Hortman’s killing, the Minnesota house of representatives she served in was evenly split 67-67 between Democrats and Republicans.
Hortman’s official website says she and her husband have two children.
Walz said that the gunman went to the Hortmans’ residence after shooting senator John Hoffman and his wife multiple times in their home in the nearby town of Champlin.
They underwent surgery, Walz said, adding that he was “cautiously optimistic” that they would survive “this assassination attempt”.
“This was an act of targeted political violence,” he said.
“Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint.”
Law enforcement officials said the gunman attacked the Hoffmans at around 2am and then drove about five miles to the Hortmans’ residence.
Brooklyn Park police chief Mark Bruley said that a “very intuitive” police sergeant who responded to the Hoffman attack asked colleagues to “proactively” check the Hortmans’ residence.
The two officers arriving at the Hortmans’ home saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in the driveway with its emergency lights on and an individual dressed and equipped as a police officer leaving the home, he said.
The suspect “immediately fired upon the officers, who exchanged gunfire and the suspect retreated back into the home”, Bruley continued.
The suspect wore a vest with a taser, other police equipment and a badge when he fled the home.
The Hortmans and Hoffmans were on the list of names found in the suspect’s car, officials said.
The FBI called the shooting a “deliberate and violent attack on public servants and their families”.
It offered a reward of up to US$50,000 for information leading to the suspect’s arrest.
Political violence surge
The pre-dawn Minnesota killings come amid a surge in US political attacks in recent years, underscoring the dark side of the nation’s deepening political divisions.
These include the attempted 2020 kidnapping of Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and a man who broke into Democratic Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro’s residence in April and set it on fire.
In July last year, then-candidate Trump escaped an assassination attempt by a gunman while speaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.
The Texas department of public safety said it arrested a person in connection with a threat against state lawmakers who had planned to attend a protest at the state capitol in Austin, which it evacuated.
There was no indication of a direct link to the Minnesota killings.
Trump has faced criticism from some opponents over his handling of incidents involving political violence.
In one of his first moves in office earlier this year, Trump pardoned nearly everyone criminally charged with participating in the Jan 6, 2021, Capitol attack.
------------------------------
WASHINGTON, June 15 — A manhunt was underway yesterday for a gunman who shot two Democratic state lawmakers in Minnesota, killing one and her husband and wounding the other, in what the northern US state’s governor said were politically motivated attacks.
  The shootings came as deep political divisions have riven the United States, the same day that tens of thousands of protestors across the country took to the streets against the policies of Republican President Donald Trump.
  Authorities named the assailant as 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, who was still at large and considered “armed and dangerous.”
  “We believe he’s working to potentially flee the (Minneapolis-St Paul) area,” said Drew Evans, superintendent of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, at a press conference.
  Boelter had been spotted Saturday morning in the Minneapolis area on video surveillance footage obtained from a business, the official said.
  Evans said authorities were still investigating the suspect’s motives, and did not know if additional people were involved in the attacks.
  Trump and US Attorney General Pam Bondi decried what they called “horrific violence” and said perpetrators would be prosecuted to “the fullest extent of the law.”

  ‘Targeted political violence’  
  State Representative Melissa Hortman — the former speaker — and her husband Mark were killed at their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park, Governor Tim Walz told an earlier press conference.
  State Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were shot and wounded at their home in nearby Champlin, the governor said, his voice breaking with emotion.
  “This was an act of targeted political violence,” Walz told reporters. “Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint.”
  Evans said Hoffman was out of surgery and “in stable condition” but that he had suffered “significant injuries.”
  The state official said Hoffman and his wife were shot first, and as police investigated, Hortman and her husband were shot about 90 minutes later.
  The gunman was able to escape during an exchange of fire with officers near Hortman’s residence, Evans said.
  Praetorian Guards Security Services, a home security company, described Boelter on its website as its director of security patrols.

  Impersonating law enforcement  
  In both attacks, authorities believe the assailant was impersonating a law enforcement officer.
  An anti-Trump rally in Minneapolis — part of the national wave of “No Kings” protests planned for yesterday — was cancelled after police issued a shelter-in-place order because of the shootings.
  Flyers for the protests were found in the suspect’s car, as well as a manifesto that named numerous politicians and state officials, police said.
  Tensions were high across the country, and in Texas authorities said they evacuated the state capitol complex after a “credible threat towards state lawmakers planning to attend a protest later today.”
  In Brooklyn Park, where Hortman lived, authorities lifted a shelter-in-place order yesterday afternoon, saying that while the suspect remained at large, there was “reason to believe he is no longer in the area.”
  The United States has been deeply divided since Trump returned to the White House in January.
  The Republican president has drawn criticism from Democrats over his harsh immigration policy, his assault on universities and the media and a perceived flouting of limits on executive power as he pushes his agenda.
  “At this precipice moment we’re on, this tragic act here in Minnesota should serve as a reminder to all of us,” Walz said.
  “The democracy and the debates in the halls of Congress, in state houses, in school boards, is a way to settle our differences peacefully and move society to a better place.”
  US Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota remembered Hortman as a friend who dedicated her life to serving the state, working on issues such as women’s rights and clean energy.
  Former US congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived a shooting to the head in 2011 and is now a prominent advocate for the prevention of gun violence, described herself as “devastated” by Hortman’s death.
  “We must protect our democracy from those who try to destroy it with a gun,” Giffords wrote on X. — AFP

MINNEAPOLIS, June 15 — The suspect in the deadly shooting of a Minnesota state lawmaker and wounding of another had links to evangelical ministries and said he was a security expert with experience in the Gaza Strip and Africa, according to his online postings and public records.
  A manhunt was under way yesterday for Vance Luther Boelter, 57, who police said is a suspect in the killing of Democratic Minnesota state legislator Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the shooting of State Senator John Hoffman and his wife.
  Police said the suspect had been seen earlier on Saturday wearing a light-coloured cowboy hat, a dark coloured long sleeved collared shirt or coat with a dark bag. The FBI offered a reward of up to US$50,000 for information that could lead to his arrest.
  David Carlson, 59, told Reuters that he has been sharing a house in Minneapolis with Boelter for a little more than a year and last saw him on Friday night. Then about 6am yesterday, he received a text from Boelter.
  “He said that he might be dead soon,” said Carlson, who called police.
  Carlson, who has known Boelter since fourth grade, said Boelter worked for an eye donation centre and stayed at the house because it was close to his job. Carlson said he feels betrayed by Boelter and heartbroken for the victims, adding: “His family has got to suffer through this.”
  Boelter was appointed in 2016 to the Governor’s Workforce Development Board, state records show. The board “has a responsibility to advise the Governor on Minnesota’s workforce system,” according to its website.

  Political anger? 
  Asked if Boelter knew the lawmakers, Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said: “We are still exploring that.”
  “There’s certainly some overlap with some public meetings, I will say, with Senator Hoffman and the individual. But we don’t know the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other,” he told reporters.
  Boelter listed himself as having no political party preference. On a LinkedIn post six years ago, Boelter urged Americans to vote and value the process: “If you believe in prayer, please keep the United States in your prayers.”
  Carlson said Boelter voted for Trump, was a Christian and did not like abortion, though he added that the pair had not talked about the issue for a long time, adding: “He wasn’t really angry about politics.”
  In social media accounts, public records and websites reviewed by Reuters, Boelter described himself as a Christian minister, a security expert with experience in the Middle East and Africa, and a former employee of food service companies.
  Boelter said he was the chief executive of an organisation called the Red Lion Group, based in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He and his wife, Jennifer, also ran a security service called Praetorian Guard Security Services LLC; Minnesota corporate records list her as a manager.
  The company website says it offers only armed guard security services, and Boelter wrote that he had been “involved with security situations in Eastern Europe, Africa, North America and the Middle East, including the West Bank, Southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.” The claims could not be immediately verified.
  Police were aware of reports that Boelter owned a security company, Evans said.

  Looking for work 
  Boelter wrote on LinkedIn a month ago that he was looking for work: “Hi everyone! I’m looking to get back into the US Food Industry and I’m pretty open to positions” in Texas, Minnesota, Florida and the Washington DC area.
  Nonprofit tax filings show that Boelter and his wife ran a Christian ministry organisation called Revoformation. The most recent filing, in 2010, lists Boelter as president.
  On an archived version of the Revoformation web page from 2011, Boelter said he was ordained in 1993 as a minister, and had been raised in the small town of Sleepy Eye, about 100 miles south-west of Minneapolis.
  In his biography on that site, Boelter claimed to have made trips to “violent areas in the Gaza Strip and West Bank where suicide bombings were taking place.”
  “He sought out militant Islamists in order to share the gospel and tell them that violence wasn’t the answer,” the biography says. Boelter said he went to St. Cloud State University, the now-closed Cardinal Stritch University and the Christ for the Nations Institute, a Bible college in Dallas.
  After firing at police yesterday, the suspect abandoned a vehicle in which officers found a “manifesto” and a list of other legislators and officials, law enforcement officials said.
  Evans said police were still exploring what could have been the motivation for the shootings, adding: “It would be premature for me at this point to really say exactly what the motivation might be from these writings.”

STUTTGART, Germany (Reuters) -German top seed Alexander Zverev took out American third seed Ben Shelton with a 7-6(8) 7-6(1) victory in the semi-finals of the Stuttgart Open on Saturday to set up a showdown with Taylor Fritz.
  Zverev and Shelton tested each other in a high-quality encounter before the world number three played a near flawless tiebreak to clinch the match in little over two hours and stretch his career win-loss record over the American to 3-0.
  The 28-year-old banged down 15 aces, 35 winners and did not face a break point in front of his home crowd to reach his first grasscourt final in eight years.
  "I'm super happy to be in the final, it's my first grasscourt final since 2017," Zverev said. "It's been eight years. I actually really like playing on the surface. I'm happy to be in the final in Germany again, I'm looking forward to it."
  Despite the defeat, Shelton will take plenty of positives from the ATP 250 event, with the 22-year-old set to make his top 10 debut in the ATP rankings on Monday.
  In the first semi-final, Fritz, ranked seventh in the world, sent down 10 aces and 23 winners, winning 86% of his first-serve points to knock out Canadian fourth seed Felix Auger Aliassime 6-4 7-6(5).
  "The claycourt season wasn't the best for me, so I came here more motivated to start the grass season off well," said Fritz after reaching his first tour-level final since November. "I'm super happy that I've been able to start it off with a final.
  "I'm locked in and ready to go. Once I start winning a couple of matches on grass and start feeling good, all the other things start clicking for me."
  The second seed is eyeing a fourth grasscourt title, as he looks to continue to build momentum towards Wimbledon, where the 27-year-old is a twice quarter-finalist.
  Fritz holds a 7-5 head-to-head win-loss record against Zverev heading into Sunday's final.

M Kumar said police view the misuse of technology, including AI, for fraudulent or defamatory purposes seriously as it could tarnish a party’s reputation. (Bernama pic)
PETALING JAYA
:
Johor police chief M Kumar tonight denied that he had received aid from one “Datok Abdul Malik” after a video clip featuring a man resembling him made its rounds on social media.
Kumar said the video had used an artificial intelligence-generated image, Bernama reported.
“The claim in the video that I had deposited the funds into a bank account is fake and baseless,” he was quoted as saying.
A report was subsequently lodged by an officer from the Johor police to enable an investigation under Section 419 and Section 420 of the Penal Code for impersonation and cheating, respectively.
The case is also being probed under Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 for improper use of network facilities.
Kumar said Johor police viewed the misuse of technology, including AI, for fraudulent or defamatory purposes seriously as it could tarnish the reputation of any party.

  JOHOR BAHRU, June 15 — Johor Police Chief CP Datuk M. Kumar has denied the authenticity of a viral TikTok video allegedly showing an individual resembling him receiving aid from a man going by the name of  “Datok Abdul Malik”.
  In a statement yesterday, Kumar said the video was false and had been manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
  “The video, which is linked to the receipt of aid from an individual named Datok Abdul Malik and supposedly deposited into a bank, is fake and baseless,” he said.
  Accordingly, a report was lodged by an officer from the Johor Police Media Unit to refute the video’s legitimacy, and an investigation is currently underway under Section 419 and Section 420/511 of the Penal Code, as well as Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998.
  Kumar said Johor police take seriously the misuse of technology, including AI, for fraudulent or defamatory purposes that could tarnish the reputation of any party.
  The public is advised not to further disseminate the video and to always verify the authenticity of information before believing or sharing content on social media.
  Police also urge anyone with information related to the spread of the fake video to come forward and assist with investigations by contacting the nearest police station. — Bernama

KUALA LUMPUR, June 14 (Bernama) -- The sixth round of United States–Iran nuclear negotiations, scheduled for Sunday in Muscat, will no longer take place, Oman’s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi confirmed on X.
  The round, set to follow five previous sessions beginning in April -- with talks alternating between Muscat and Rome -- had aimed to replace the 2015 nuclear agreement (JCPOA) through indirect discussions led by US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
  Despite the cancellation,  Albusaidi added that “diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace.”
  Oman has played a discreet but critical mediating role throughout the process, serving as host and intermediary.
  Regional escalation, including latest Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Iran’s subsequent missile response, contributed to the postponement.
  The heightened tensions have cast doubt on the viability of further talks, international media reported.

BERLIN
:
Germany, France and Britain are ready to hold immediate talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme in a bid to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East, German foreign minister Johann Wadephul said.
Wadephul, who is on a visit to the Middle East, said he was trying to contribute towards a de-escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran, and noted Tehran had previously failed to take the opportunity to enter into constructive talks.
“I hope that’s still possible,” Wadephul told German public broadcaster ARD late on Saturday. “Germany, together with France and Britain are ready. We’re offering Iran immediate negotiations about the nuclear programme, I hope (the offer) is accepted.”
“This is also a key prerequisite for reaching a pacification of this conflict, that Iran presents no danger to the region, for the state of Israel or to Europe.”

(Reuters) -Donald Trump reported more than $600 million in income from crypto, golf clubs, licensing and other ventures in a public financial disclosure report released on Friday that provided a glimpse of the vast business holdings of America’s billionaire president.
  The annual financial disclosure form, which appeared to cover the 2024 calendar year, shows the president's push into crypto added substantially to his wealth but he also reported large fees from developments and revenues from his other businesses. Overall, the president reported assets worth at least $1.6 billion, a Reuters calculation shows.
  While Trump has said he has put his businesses into a trust managed by his children, the disclosures show how income from those sources still ultimately accrue to the president - something that has opened him to accusations of conflicts of interest. 
  Some of his businesses in areas such as crypto, for example, benefit from U.S. policy shifts under him and have become a source of criticism.
  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  The financial disclosure was signed on June 13 and did not state the time period it covered. The details of the cryptocurrency listings, as well as other information in the disclosure, suggest it was through the end of December 2024, which would exclude most of the money raised by the family's cryptocurrency ventures.
  Given the speed at which the Trump family has made deals during his ascent to the presidency, the filing is already a time capsule of sorts, capturing a period when the family was just starting to get into crypto but was largely still in the world of real estate deals and golf clubs.
  A meme coin released earlier this year by the president - $TRUMP - alone has earned an estimated $320 million in fees, although it’s not publicly known how that amount has been divided between a Trump-controlled entity and its partners. 
  In addition to the meme coin fees, the Trump family has raked in more than $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance company. The Trump family is involved, also, with a bitcoin mining operation and digital asset exchange-traded funds.
  In the disclosures, Trump reported $57.35 million from token sales at World Liberty. He also reported holding 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture.
  TRUMP MEDIA
  The wealth of the Republican businessman-turned-politician ranges from crypto to real estate, and a large part on paper is tied up in his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of social media platform Truth Social. 
  Besides assets and revenues from his business ventures, the president reported at least $12 million in income, including through interest and dividends, from passive investments totaling at least $211 million, a Reuters calculation shows. 
  His biggest investments were in alternative fund manager Blue Owl Capital Corp and in government bond funds managed by Charles Schwab and Invesco.
  The disclosure often only gave ranges for the value of his assets and income; Reuters used the lower amount listed, meaning the total value of his assets and income was almost certainly higher.
  The disclosure showed income from various assets including Trump's properties in Florida. Trump's three golf-focused resorts in the state - Jupiter, Doral and West Palm Beach - plus his nearby private members' club at Mar-a-Lago generated at least $217.7 million in income, according to the filing. 
  Trump National Doral, the expansive Miami-area golf hub known for its Blue Monster course, was the family's single largest income source at $110.4 million. The income figures provided are essentially revenues, not net profits after subtracting costs.
  The disclosure underlined the global nature of the Trump family business, listing income of $5 million in license fees from a development in Vietnam, $10 million in development fees from a project in India and almost $16 million in licensing fees for a Dubai project.
  Trump collected royalty money, also, from a variety of deals - $1.3 million from the Greenwood Bible (its website describes it as "the only Bible officially endorsed by Lee Greenwood and President Trump"); $2.8 million from Trump Watches, and $2.5 million from Trump Sneakers and Fragrances.
  Trump listed $1.16 million in income from his NFTs - digital trading cards in his likeness - while First Lady Melania Trump earned around $216,700 from license fees on her own NFT collection.

WASHINGTON: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump melaporkan pendapatan berjumlah ratusan juta dolar hasil daripada pelaburan kripto, kelab golf dan usaha pelesenan, menurut laporan pendedahan kewangan awam yang dikeluarkan kelmarin. Laporan itu turut mendedahkan skala luas pegangan perniagaan Trump sepanjang tahun 2024. Borang pendedahan kewangan tahunan tersebut, yang merangkumi tahun kalendar 2024, menunjukkan penglibatan Trump dalam mata wang kripto menyumbang besar kepada kekayaannya, selain bayaran besar daripada projek pembangunan serta hasil perniagaan lain. Walaupun Trump menyerahkan pengurusan perniagaan kepada anak-anaknya, laporan itu mendedahkan beliau masih menerima hasil daripadanya, dengan situasi…

(Reuters) -Canada's WestJet Airlines is investigating a cybersecurity incident that has disrupted access to its mobile app and some internal systems, affecting an undisclosed number of users, the airlines said in a statement on Friday.
  WestJet said specialised internal teams are working alongside law enforcement and Transport Canada to limit the impact and determine the scope of the breach.
  "We are expediting efforts to maintain the safety of our operation and safeguard sensitive data and personal information for both our guests and employees," the statement said.
  The carrier added that it is too early to speculate on further details or the potential scope of the incident.
  WestJet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  Canada's critical infrastructure has seen a rise in cyber threats. Earlier in April, energy provider Emera and its subsidiary Nova Scotia Power disclosed a cyber intrusion that involved unauthorized access to parts of their network and business servers.

警方称，李某办理了大量假证件，包括大学、博士等学历学位证书，还有主持人、媒体人等职业证明，还开设自媒体账号，将自己包装成了一个所谓的民间智库专家。

（关丹15日讯）手机店主惊魂一刻，险遭缅甸籍女子
割喉
。
一名手机店业者在理想花园，遭遇惊险一幕，险些被一名无证缅甸籍女子持刀割喉。
ADVERTISEMENT
关丹警区主任旺莫哈末查哈里透过文告表示，警方于昨日下午3时41分接获民众紧急报案，称上述店铺发生持刀抢劫事件。 “据受害者描述，案发前，这名39岁女嫌犯到店内购买了一张价值30令吉的预付卡，并以现金支付。 ”
“受害者试图与嫌犯攀谈，询问其来历，因对方看起来神情慌乱。嫌犯自称是从新山来到此地。”
他补充说，嫌犯随后请求受害者帮忙为其手机充电。受害者同意后，拿起手机走向柜台充电。
“然而，当受害者转身背对嫌犯时，对方突然用剃须刀片抵住其颈部。”
“受害者迅速回头并拍开嫌犯的手，双方随即发生扭打。但受害者强调，嫌犯并未索要钱财或进行任何勒索。”
他指出，害者快速反应，并成功呼救，周围民众将嫌犯反锁在店内，同时其同伴报警并呼叫救护车。

 潜逃31年的杀人犯在成为网红智库专家后终落网。（互联网照片） 
（北京14日综合电）央视《法治在线》节目播出了大连警方破获一起31年前的积案。案发1994年8月18日晚10时，在辽宁大连甘井子区某村里，发生了一起故意伤害致人死亡的案件。大连市公安局民警景昌鹏介绍：“当晚，犯罪嫌疑人李某和他母亲高某珍等3人因琐事与都某财、王某国两人发生了纠纷，在争吵的过程中，李某看见自己母亲与他人发生了推搡，气不过就拿起刀，分别捅向了都某财和王某国。”
李某的行为最终造成都某财受伤、王某国死亡的惨剧。见到自己闯下大祸，李某当即选择逃跑。接到报案后，警方第一时间组织开展追捕抓逃。但碍于那个时候监控

比较少等客观条件的制约，警方始终没有抓到他。
2025年，警方发现，常年活跃在北京、以自媒体人及网红身份出现、擅长热点分析和金融咨询的“王某”，与李某形像高度相似，经深入侦查，诸多信息高度吻合。

警方表示，李某先潜逃到内蒙古一个非常偏僻的地方，后又到了吉林，2012年在河北找到一家黑中介，给自己伪造了王某柱的假身份。随后就用王某柱的身份到北京发展，并借落户的机会，再次改名“王某”。虽然只有初中文凭，但凭借著能说会道和擅长唱歌乐器，洗白之后的李某常年混迹在各种圈子当中，并用各种方式包装自己。

警方称，李某办理了大量假证件，包括大学、博士等学历学位证书，还有主持人、媒体人等职业证明，还开设自媒体账号，将自己包装成了一个所谓的民间智库专家。


今年2月17日，在北京警方的配合下，正在北京市某美术馆内组织文化活动的李某被大连警方当场抓获。据悉，当其时李某已购买出国机票，正打算潜逃到国外。
经审讯，李某对犯罪事实供认不讳。目前，李某因涉嫌故意伤害致人死亡罪已被检察机关提起公诉。

佯装没有看过马币，一名老者模模糊糊从钱包掏出钱后被骗200令吉！
和丰福建会馆会长刘凌源向星洲日报《大霹雳》社区报透露，这起事件日前发生在竹芭西湖，当时事主正骑摩托车工作经过西湖，一名乘坐轿车的貌似中东男子截停他询问哪里有餐馆，老者回应需折返大路才有。
ADVERTISEMENT
他说，中东男接着问是否可以给他看一下马币因为没看过，事主不疑有他马上从钱包掏出钱给中东男看，过一会中东男将钱还回老者若无其事离开。
“事主过一阵子后突然回过神来，立即点算钱包里的钱，其明明放了1000令吉，现在只剩下800令吉，200令吉已不翼而飞。事主过后到街上谈起自身遭遇，这时一名朋友回应也上当过，损失数百令吉。”
他续说，市民尤其乐龄人士应提高警惕，遇到这些骗钱伎俩时千万不要上当，当骗子佯装要看马币时，应该不予理会立即拒绝。
“受骗者应该去警局报案，就算损失不多，警方至少有实证可以展开调查，如果没人报案，警方根本无从入手让骗子继续逍遥法外。”

LONDON (Reuters) -Bath ended their 29-year English title drought when they survived a late surge by old rivals Leicester to triumph 23-21 in a gripping Premiership final and complete a memorable trophy treble at Twickenham on Saturday.
  Tries by Thomas du Toit and Max Ojomoh, after an outrageous play by flyhalf Finn Russell, gave Bath a healthy lead in the second half that looked set to underline their dominance of a campaign in which they finished the regular season 11 points clear of Leicester.
  Leicester, however, seeking a record-extending 12th title, hit back with tries by Solomone Kata and Emeka Ilione either side of a Russell penalty to set up a nail-biting finale.
  Bath, who lost a similarly close game to Northampton a year ago, held out, though, to complete a memorable treble after they also lifted the Premiership Cup and European Challenge Cup having not won a domestic trophy since their 1996 league and cup double.

Four-star wide receiver Messiah Hampton committed to Oregon's Class of 2026.
  Hampton got to know the Ducks' receiver coach, Ross Douglas, when the coach worked at Syracuse. Douglas recruited Hampton, who plays at James Monroe High School in Rochester, N.Y., at the time.
  And when Douglas moved on to Oregon in February, so did his interest in Hampton, a 6-foot-1, 180-pound wideout.
  Hampton on Friday chose Oregon from among the list of finalists he announced in May, which also included Penn State, Ohio State, Michigan, Georgia and Miami, as well as Syracuse.
  He took official visits to Syracuse and Miami over the past few weeks.
  Hampton told 247Sports recently that his choice of school would be based on where he could see the most development and where he envisioned himself best fitting into an offensive scheme.
  Hampton had 56 catches for 869 yards and eight touchdowns in the 2025 season.
  The 247Sports composite lists Hampton as the No. 11 wide receiver nationally and the No. 1 player in New York.

KUALA LUMPUR: Pembinaan Akademi Sepak Takraw akan disegerakan sempena Sambutan Hari Belia Negara (HBN) 2025 yang disambut di Dataran Merdeka di sini, malam ini.
  Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim berkata, beliau meluluskan penubuhan akademi itu selepas mendapat permintaan daripada Menteri Belia dan Sukan, Hannah Yeoh yang mahu melihat sukan itu setanding dengan bola sepak.
  “Sukan sepak takraw telah mencatat statistik yang membanggakan di peringkat rantau ini. Hampir setiap kampung, desa dan bandar mempunyai pasukan dan permainan takraw. Kita hidupkan sukan yang mempunyai kaitan dengan seni dan budaya.
  “Kita akan jadikan Akademi Sepak Takraw satu realiti di Malaysia dan berharap ia boleh ditubuhkan sebelum hujung tahun ini,” katanya semasa berucap merasmikan Sambutan HBN 2025.
  Akademi Sepak Takraw dijangka beroperasi di Stadium Jalan Raja Muda, Kampung Baru.
  Ia merupakan pusat pembangunan sepak takraw peringkat akar umbi dan elit yang dikendalikan sepenuhnya oleh Persatuan Sepak Takraw Malaysia (PSM).
  Kementerian Belia dan Sukan membuat permohonan peruntukan sebanyak RM6 juta bagi penubuhan akademi tersebut.
  Dalam majlis sama, Anwar turut mengumumkan peruntukan RM4 juta kepada Majlis Belia Malaysia (MBM).
  HBN 2025 merupakan platform besar buat belia untuk menyuarakan aspirasi, mempamerkan bakat dan membentuk masa depan negara.
  Sambutan penuh meriah itu dihadiri kira-kira 5,000 belia dari seluruh negara.
  Bertemakan Yakin Boleh, sambutan tahun ini mengetengahkan lebih 130 aktiviti melalui lima segmen utama antaranya Port Jana Duit (TVET dan kerjaya), Port Healing (kesihatan mental), Port Gaming (e-sukan), Port Wadah Insan, serta Pavilion ASEAN yang menampilkan keterlibatan belia dari 10 negara anggota ASEAN.
  Penganjuran HBN 2025 mencerminkan komitmen berterusan Kementerian Belia dan Sukan (KBS) bersama MBM dan rakan strategik dalam memperkasa pembangunan belia melalui pendekatan yang inklusif, progresif dan sejajar dengan arus Revolusi Industri 4.0. – UTUSAN

PETALING JAYA: Pengendali Harimau Malaya, Peter Cklamovski menjanjikan kejutan buat peminat bola sepat tempatan menjelang kalendar Persekutuan Bolasepak Antarabangsa (FIFA) pada 1 hingga 9 September depan.
  Pengendali kelahiran Australia itu berkata, pihak pengurusan telah memiliki perancangan terbaik untuk persiapan pasukan kebangsaan, namun ketika ini masih terlalu awal untuk perkara itu diumumkan.
  Jelasnya, aksi persahabatan yang bakal diatur dalam tempoh tiga bulan akan datang cukup penting buat pasukan sebagai persiapan mengharungi kempen kelayakan Piala Asia 2027 yang bersambung semula pada Oktober nanti.
  “Semua teruja dengan apa yang akan berlaku pada September depan. Semua tahu kita tiada aksi kelayakan Piala Asia 2027 ketika itu. Namun, kita akan gunakan tempoh tersebut untuk mencabar keupayaan dengan mengatur perlawanan menentang pasukan yang kuat.
  “Cuma, bukan tugas saya untuk dedahkan (kepada umum) dan biarkan pihak pengurusan skuad kebangsaan yang akan memaklumkannya kelak.
  “Apa yang pasti, semua orang akan teruja kerana ini akan menjadi cabaran yang sukar dan menguji kami, sekali gus mempersiapkan pasukan sebelum kalendar Oktober depan,” katanya.
  Harimau Malaya ketika ini mencatat rekod bersih dalam aksi Kelayakan Piala Asia 2027 apabila mengutip enam mata penuh susulan kemenangan ke atas Nepal 2-0 pada aksi pertama, kemudiannya membelasah Vietnam 4-0 di Stadium Nasional Bukit Jalil pada Selasa lalu.
  Keputusan itu meletakkan Malaysia memimpin Kumpulan F Kelayakan Piala Asia 2027 dan jika momentum ini mampu diteruskan maka tiket ke Arab Saudi bakal menjadi milik skuad kendalian Cklamovski.
  Difahamkan, pasukan yang bakal menjadi lawan skuad kebangsaan pada September ini adalah pasukan dalam ranking kelompok 100 terbaik dunia meskipun tiada sebarang pengesahan daripada Persatuan Bola Sepak Malaysia (FAM).
  Pendekatan itu diambil FAM dengan tidak mendedahkan lawan lebih awal dilakukan dalam beberapa kalendar antarabangsa sejak dua tahun terakhir seperti pertemuan menentang Cape Verde, New Zealand, China dan Syria.
  Situasi itu juga menjadi faktor, badan induk bola sepak negara itu terpaksa menolak pelawaan Indonesia yang menduduki ranking ke-123 dunia untuk aksi persahabatan di Jakarta pada September depan.

PASUKAN Marang mengungguli Kejohanan Bola Sepak Bawah 12 Tahun Majlis Sukan Sekolah Terengganu buat tahun kedua berturut-turut selepas menumpaskan Kuala Nerus dalam perlawanan akhir di Padang Sekolah Kebangsaan (SK) Pusat, Kemaman, semalam.
  Rekod dan prestasi cemerlang berkenaan dicatatkan Marang selepas bangkit daripada ketinggalan jaringan pada babak pertama untuk menundukkan Kuala Nerus 3-2, sekali gus memastikan gelaran serta trofi kejohanan kekal dalam genggaman mereka.
  Kejohanan berlangsung tiga hari berakhir Sabtu lalu melibatkan lapan pasukan mewakili Majlis Sukan Sekolah Daerah (MSSD) dalam Terengganu untuk memburu kejuaraan dalam sukan nombor satu negara.
  Marang kembali muncul sebagai pasukan digeruni apabila memecahkan kebuntuan gelaran juara pada edisi 2024 dan kecemerlangan itu diteruskan kali ini. – UTUSAN

  However, since 2023, when The Exchange TRX first opened its doors, followed by Merdeka 118 in 2024, Malaysia has a lot more to offer modern architecture-wise.

LONDON (Reuters) -Dozens of members of Britain's Indian community gathered at a Hindu temple in London on Saturday for a vigil mourning the victims of this week's Air India crash, many of whom had personal connections to the temple.  
  Leaders from the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Muslim, Parsi, Zoroastrian and other communities offered their prayers, as those in attendance, hands folded, recited chants. 
  A representative of Britain's King Charles read out a message from him and offered Christian prayers.
  Rajrajeshwar Guruji, head of the Siddhashram Hindu temple in Harrow, likened the grief of those who lost family members in the crash of the London-bound flight to the wait for a loved one's return from an endless journey.
  "They're just waiting and waiting, now they are not going to come back again," he said in an interview. 
  Guruji, who comes from the state of Gujarat where the plane crashed, said the temple had helped family members in Britain get information about their loved ones.  
  "Some of the members ... I have spoken to them, and ... they don't have the words," he said. "They are in shock." 
  Britain has one of the largest Indian communities outside India, with nearly 1.69 million people - or 3.1% of the population - identifying as ethnically Indian.   
  "We believe that everyone who is born has to go one day. But I hope nobody goes the way these ... passengers, as well as the medical students, have gone," said Harrow Mayor Anjana Patel, who lost a family member.     
  Only one of the 242 passengers and crew on board survived the crash, while others were killed when the plane struck a medical college's hostel. 
  Patel told Reuters that the council was offering grief counselling. 
  "We just cannot bear how people must be feeling," she said.
  Jyotsna Shukla, 66, said her son's childhood friend was on the plane with his wife and three children. 
  "I feel very bad because he was so young," she said, before breaking down into tears.
  Among those killed was Vijay Rupani, a former chief minister of Gujarat, who had visited the temple.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -Lando Norris lapped fastest in final Canadian Grand Prix practice on Saturday as Formula One leader and McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri hit Montreal's wall of champions.
  Norris lapped the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in one minute 11.799 seconds, 0.078 quicker than Ferrari's Charles Leclerc who was back on track after crashing on Friday and missing second practice.
  The Briton had described the previous day's practice as McLaren's worst Friday of the season but appeared more comfortable in the last track time before qualifying.
  Mercedes' 2024 pole-sitter George Russell was third, 0.151 off the pace, with Ferrari's seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton fourth and 0.251 slower than Norris.
  Red Bull's Max Verstappen, chasing an unprecedented fourth successive Canadian win on Sunday, was fifth fastest with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso sixth.
  Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli was seventh and Piastri eighth, with the Australian briefly triggering red flags when he skimmed the famed wall at the last corner and scattered debris with 37 minutes to go.
  The championship leader was able to get back out again with 24 minutes remaining.   
  The Australian leads Norris by 10 points after nine of 24 rounds.
  Carlos Sainz was ninth fastest for Williams with teammate Alex Albon 10th.

力压维斯塔潘和皮亚斯特里，拉塞尔连2年在加拿大站F1排位赛都夺下杆位。（法新社照片）
（蒙特利尔15日综合电）连2季摘获加拿大站F1
杆位
的
拉塞尔
，这次能否终结
维斯塔潘
在维伦纽夫赛道的霸业，或皮亚斯特里将再次杀出？
昨日于加拿大站F1
排位赛
，马赛地主将拉塞尔在Q3飙出1分10.899秒单圈时间，最终以全场唯一达1分10秒之姿捍卫该站杆位，力压红牛车手霸主维斯塔潘和迈凯轮车手榜领头羊皮亚斯特里。
ADVERTISEMENT
拉塞尔赛后受访时直言道，“老实说，这可能是我人生中最激动人心的单圈。冲过终点线时看排名第一，真是个惊喜，我当然还是很开心。”
去年加拿大站正赛最终仅获季军的拉塞尔，此番必将放眼捍卫领跑地位至比赛结束，为马赛地拿下本季正赛首冠。
维斯塔潘头排冲击本站4连冠
而维斯塔潘（1分11.059秒）以0.16秒差距屈居次名，仍将在头排起跑、冲击加拿大站正赛4连冠，皮亚斯特里（1分11.120秒）则将从第3名展开追击。
红牛的日本车手角田裕毅在Q2屈居第11名出局，还因自由练习红旗下超车遭罚退10位，无奈榜末起跑。红牛二队新秀哈贾则因排位赛阻挡其他车手，自第9名罚退至第12名开赛。
诺里斯第3练居首
早前第3轮自由练习，迈凯轮车手诺里斯以1分11.799占据榜首、次名为法拉利的勒克莱尔、拉塞尔居第3名。
继勒克莱尔（首练）和阿斯顿马丁“太子爷”斯特罗尔（次练），第3练“轮到”皮亚斯特里和索伯老将霍肯伯格遭撞墙意外，一度引发红旗暂停赛事。

(Reuters) -Defending champions Ferrari were heading for a third straight win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, after leading the 93rd edition of the race through the night and into Sunday morning at the Sarthe circuit.
  With six hours remaining, the number 51 factory 499P car of 2023 winners Alessandro Pier Guidi, Antonio Giovinazzi and James Calado led the number 83 AF Corse entry of Robert Kubica, Yifei Yi and Philip Hanson by some six seconds.
  The number 50 factory car crewed by last year's winners Antonio Fuoco, Nicklas Nielsen and Miguel Molina completed the lockout of the podium places.
  Porsche Penske's number six hypercar, which had led at the halfway stage after a safety car period, was fourth and Toyota's number eight car fifth.   
  With six hours being the regular length of a World Endurance Championship race, and temperatures rising, there was however still plenty of room for late drama.
  The number 51 Ferrari had already fought back from eighth place after a puncture, a five second penalty and 20 second stop and go punishment to retake the lead by dawn.   
  Swiss tennis great Roger Federer had waved the French flag to get the race underway on Saturday afternoon, with Porsche immediately seizing the lead from pole-sitters Cadillac.
  Cadillac had swept the front row in Thursday's qualifying but any advantage was short-lived as Porsche Penske's Julien Andlauer slipstreamed into the lead from third on the grid before the first chicane on the opening lap.
  "We’re trying to hang in there, but it’s tough out on track to be honest," said Sebastien Bourdais, who shares the number 38 Cadillac with 2009 Formula One champion Jenson Button and was in ninth place. 
  "We’re struggling with tyre degradation. And we’re struggling with the balance." 
  Ferrari worked their way to the front and Fuoco took the lead in the third hour on the run from Mulsanne to Indianapolis with the three Ferraris running 1-2-3 at the quarter distance.
  The BMW driven by Italy's MotoGP great Valentino Rossi had to retire in the LMGT3 category.  
  The race at the circuit in north-west France features 62 cars shared by 186 drivers from 34 countries, and is the fourth round of the World Endurance Championship, with 21 hypercars in the battle for overall victory.
  Organisers have put the total weekend attendance at more than 300,000 spectators. 
  Ferrari will be able to keep the trophy at their Maranello factory if the works team completes a hat-trick on Sunday.

(Reuters) -Three early tries helped Irish side Leinster to a comprehensive 32-7 victory over South Africa’s Bulls in the United Rugby Championship (URC) final in Dublin on Saturday and a record-extending ninth title.
  The hosts were clinical with their early burst as the rain poured down, with number eight Jack Conan, centre Jordie Barrett and flanker Josh van der Flier crossing the line, before Fintan Gunne's late try finished off an outstanding display.
  The Pretoria-based Bulls have now lost three of the last four URC finals in another major disappointment, even if they were underdogs against a team packed with players in the British & Irish Lions squad travelling to Australia this month. 
  Hooker Akker van der Merwe scored the visitors' only try as Leinster made up in part for their recent shock home semi-final defeat by Northampton Saints in the European Champions Cup.

   CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has postponed the long-anticipated grand opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) due to the escalating military confrontation between Israel and Iran, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced on Saturday.
  Speaking during a press conference while touring the northern Beheira province, Madbouly said the current regional climate was not conducive to hosting a major international event. The museum's opening, originally scheduled for July 3, will now be delayed until the fourth quarter of the year.
  "The regional tension may persist for weeks," Madbouly said. "We found that the appropriate course of action is to postpone this major event, so that it can have the proper global momentum and take place in a suitable atmosphere."
  He added that a new date for the opening will be announced based on future regional developments.
  Madbouly also issued a stark warning about the broader implications of the Israel-Iran conflict, noting the growing risk of a wider confrontation across the Middle East.
  Located near the iconic Giza pyramids and spanning nearly 500,000 square meters, the GEM is billed as the world's largest archaeological museum dedicated to a single civilization. It will house approximately 57,000 artifacts, according to Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.

叶江强（右三）代表大会移交礼品给出席者。
叶江强：“孝”是根本，从小灌输孩子孝顺的观念
早前，文德甲德教会紫亨阁阁长叶江强致词时说，“百行孝为先”在所有的美德当，“孝”是根本，从小就应灌输孩子孝顺的观念。
“父母对孩子的生育之恩重如山，深似海，所以身为孩子者要懂得孝道，行善尽孝，趁父母还健在的时候就要多尽孝。
“
有时候，孩子为表达孝心，送上小礼物给父母，身为父母千万不要轻忽，更不要拒绝。
孩子送礼不是物质的价值，而是他们在学习行善、积德、积福
。
当孩子有这样的孝心，我们就要学会接受，因为每一次善念的培养，都是为孩子未来种下福田。”
他也说，
要孩子学会孝顺，最有效的方式不是说教，而是身教。当我们自己如何对待长辈，孩子都看在眼里、记在心里，自然会学做孝顺的人，在
心中埋下一颗颗孝顺的种子。
“
让我们从自己做起，将孝道落实在生活中，传承给下一代。因为一个懂得感恩与孝顺的孩子，不只为家庭带来幸福，也为社会注入更多温暖与善良。”
在场嘉宾尚有德教会紫亨阁署理阁长杨春发、副阁长黄定发、陈锦昌、妇女组主席郑美华、总务汤闰添、副总务罗婉仪、财政
锺梽汶、
宣教组主任张良威、教育组主任吴俐妍、康乐主任陈玉珍、医药主任卢锦凤、星洲日报东海岸高级业务主任欧阳秀媚和东海岸发行主任陈钜新等。

锺梽汶（右起）在杨春发的陪同下，赠送纪念品给欧阳秀媚。
文德甲多户家庭纷纷携带父母或长辈出席双亲节晚宴，共度欢乐温馨时光。
出席者邹秀媚（后排左四）
“双亲节，是我们向长辈表达孝心的时刻，每年的双亲节，我们都会齐聚一堂庆祝。今次则携带父母亲、家翁和家人一起参与双亲节晚宴，在这个充满感恩于爱的日子，能够与家人团聚一起说笑、分享欢乐时间，是最简单且珍贵的幸福时光。”
黄定发（左一）
“三代同堂温馨齐聚，欢庆双亲节。母亲今年已86高龄，能够牵起母亲的手，与孩子们一起用心过节，这样的的陪伴，比任何礼物都来得真实与温暖。”
出席者杨春发和郑美华夫妇（前排左三及四）
“孩子分别从槟城和吉隆坡回到家乡，与我们庆祝双亲节。在双亲节这天，与家人相聚的每一刻都特别有意义，最好的礼物就是家人的陪伴，与家人团聚的时刻弥足珍贵。”

 叶江强（右三）代表大会移交礼品给出席者。 叶江强：“孝”是根本，从小灌输孩子孝顺的观念
早前，文德甲德教会紫亨阁阁长叶江强致词时说，“百行孝为先”在所有的美德当，“孝”是根本，从小就应灌输孩子孝顺的观念。

“父母对孩子的生育之恩重如山，深似海，所以身为孩子者要懂得孝道，行善尽孝，趁父母还健在的时候就要多尽孝。

“有时候，孩子为表达孝心，送上小礼物给父母，身为父母千万不要轻忽，更不要拒绝。孩子送礼不是物质的价值，而是他们在学习行善、积德、积福。当孩子有这样的孝心，我们就要学会接受，因为每一次善念的培养，都是为孩子未来种下福田。”
他也说，要孩子学会孝顺，最有效的方式不是说教，而是身教。当我们自己如何对待长辈，孩子都看在眼里、记在心里，自然会学做孝顺的人，在心中埋下一颗颗孝顺的种子。
“让我们从自己做起，将孝道落实在生活中，传承给下一代。因为一个懂得感恩与孝顺的孩子，不只为家庭带来幸福，也为社会注入更多温暖与善良。”
在场嘉宾尚有德教会紫亨阁署理阁长杨春发、副阁长黄定发、陈锦昌、妇女组主席郑美华、总务汤闰添、副总务罗婉仪、财政锺梽汶、宣教组主任张良威、教育组主任吴俐妍、康乐主任陈玉珍、医药主任卢锦凤、星洲日报东海岸高级业务主任欧阳秀媚和东海岸发行主任陈钜新等。

“双亲节，是我们向长辈表达孝心的时刻，每年的双亲节，我们都会齐聚一堂庆祝。今次则携带父母亲、家翁和家人一起参与双亲节晚宴，在这个充满感恩于爱的日子，能够与家人团聚一起说笑、分享欢乐时间，是最简单且珍贵的幸福时光。”
黄定发（左一）
“三代同堂温馨齐聚，欢庆双亲节。母亲今年已86高龄，能够牵起母亲的手，与孩子们一起用心过节，这样的的陪伴，比任何礼物都来得真实与温暖。”
出席者杨春发和郑美华夫妇（前排左三及四）
“孩子分别从槟城和吉隆坡回到家乡，与我们庆祝双亲节。在双亲节这天，与家人相聚的每一刻都特别有意义，最好的礼物就是家人的陪伴，与家人团聚的时刻弥足珍贵。”

OAKMONT, Pennsylvania (Reuters) -Rory McIlroy, who has come under fire for avoiding media after six consecutive major championship rounds, ended that silent run on Saturday at the U.S. Open where he said he felt he earned the right to do as he pleases.
  PGA Tour players are not obligated to speak to the media after their rounds but for someone like world number two McIlroy, who has been the de facto spokesman of the U.S.-based circuit in recent years, it has come to be expected.
  Following a four-over 74 that left well out of contention at Oakmont Country Club, McIlroy spoke to reporters and was asked if his drop in form since winning the Masters was why he decided to avoid the media outside of pre-tournament availabilities.
  "No, not really. It's more a frustration with you guys," McIlroy told reporters at Oakmont Country Club before being asked to elaborate.
  "I'm just, yeah, I don't know. I have, I've been totally available for the last few years, and I'm not saying -- maybe not you guys, but maybe more just the whole thing."
  McIlroy's silent stretch at the majors began at last month's PGA Championship where he declined to speak to the media after a poor first round and held firm after news of his driver failing a conformance test leaked during the second round.
  McIlroy said the leaked news was part of his decision to go silent but also reminded the assembled media that he walked by them without taking questions after his opening round of this year's Masters.
  "It's not as if -- it's not out of the ordinary. I've done it before; I'm just doing it a little more often," said McIlroy. "I feel like I've earned the right to do whatever I want to do, yeah."
  The 36-year-old Northern Irishman knows the rules do not permit him to talk to media after he walks off the course and it was suggested that he was almost daring the PGA Tour to alter its rules on the matter.
  "No, I'm not daring them to do anything. I hope they don't change it because... it's a nice luxury to have," said McIlroy. "But I'm just pointing out the fact that we have the ability to do it."
  The five-times major champion, who like many top players struggled mightily at a treacherous Oakmont layout where some rounds have been well above five hours long, rallied to make the cut on Friday with little to lose.
  "Yeah, it's funny, like it's much easier being on the cut line when you don't really care if you're here for the weekend or not," said McIlroy.
  "I was sort of thinking, do I really want two more days here or not. So it makes it easier to play better when you're in that mindset."
  When McIlroy was asked what his expectations were for Sunday's final round he made it crystal clear that he is counting down the hours until he can get home.
  "Hopefully a round in under four and a half hours and get out of here," said McIlroy.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -George Russell put his Mercedes on pole position in Canada for the second year in a row on Saturday with Red Bull rival Max Verstappen alongside on the front row.
  McLaren's Formula One championship leader Oscar Piastri qualified third with Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli in fourth place.
  Lando Norris, Piastri's teammate and closest title rival only 10 points behind the Australian, qualified seventh at Montreal's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.

  MONTREAL: George Russell set the pace for Mercedes in the second Canadian Grand Prix practice on Friday after Red Bull’s Formula One champion Max Verstappen led the opening session at Montreal’s Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.
  Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc sat out the later session after crashing in the first, leaving mechanics plenty of work to repair the car.
  
------------------------------
MONTREAL (Reuters) -Max Verstappen showed his irritation with questions about penalty points and race bans after qualifying on the front row for Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix alongside old foe George Russell.
  Mercedes' Russell took pole position for the second year in a row with Red Bull's Verstappen, who is chasing a fourth successive Canadian victory, second fastest.
  The race will be the first since the Formula One rivals collided in Spain, an incident that left Verstappen one penalty point away from a mandatory ban.
  Asked about "the penalty points thing" at a post-qualifying press conference, Verstappen -- who is third in the championship with Russell fourth -- did not hold back.
  "I don’t need to hear it again. It’s really pissing me off. I mean, you were speaking about it on Thursday. It’s such a waste of time. It’s very childish," he said.
  "So, that’s why I also don’t want to say too much because it’s really annoying, this world that we live in."
  Verstappen acknowledged after Spain that he made a mistake in driving into Russell, an incident stemming from frustration at having to hand back a place, but the topic has followed him to Canada.
  With the pair lining up alongside each other, the paddock was full of discussion about what might happen on the short run down to the first corner in Sunday's race.
  The pair could never be described as good friends, the bad blood between them laid bare at last year's Abu Dhabi season-ender when they publicly traded accusations of bullying and lying. 
  Russell joked on Saturday that he had fewer penalty points on his super-licence, and therefore more room to play with, but seriously did not expect any real advantage.
  "I don’t think any driver goes out looking to crash into somebody and get penalty points on your licence. Max is one of the best drivers," he said. 
  "There’s no reason for him to race any differently, and I’m not sitting here thinking he’s going to give us more room. If anything, probably the opposite to try and prove a point.
  "Ultimately, we’re all here to win. You’re not going to do something that’s going to jeopardise yourself from the race. It’s a busy season as well. If you get a race ban, you get a race ban and spend some time at home."

MONTREAL, June 15 — Mercedes’ George Russell grabbed a dazzling pole position and then enjoyed cracking a joke at rival Max Verstappen’s expense yesterday after clocking a sensational lap in qualifying for today’s Canadian Grand Prix.
  The 27-year-old Briton was delighted with what he described as “one of the most exhilarating laps of my life” and said, when asked about the prospect of starting alongside Red Bull’s four-time champion, that he had “a few more penalty points to play with”.
  His light-hearted jibe referred to his verbal rivalry with Verstappen since last season and their recent clash at the Spanish Grand Prix — where the Dutchman rammed into Russell’s car in the closing stages.
  Verstappen was handed a timed penalty that dropped him to 10th and also given three points on his drivers’ super-licence, taking him to a total of 11 and within one point of a ban if he commits any further misdemeanours.
  Fans in the capacity crowd at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve roared their approval as Russell warmed to his theme after clocking the only sub 1.11 lap of the weekend to date.
  “We’re mates, so it’s all good,” insisted Russell, despite his tense and often strained relationship with Verstappen who, in Barcelona, said “give him some tissues” after their clash.
  “But I’ve got a few more points on my license to play with so, yeah, let’s see,” Russell said.
  It may have been good-natured fun, but it was also a reminder to Verstappen that he cannot risk repeating his “red mist” aggression and a possible race ban today.
  Russell captured his first pole this year at the end of a thrilling session.
  Russell clocked a best lap in one minute and 10.899 seconds to outpace Verstappen by 0.160 seconds.
  “On my steering wheel, you’ve got the delta and I just saw every corner that I was just going one-tenth quicker and I got into the last corner and I was six-tenths off so I knew the lap was mighty,” Russell said.
  “Crossing the line and seeing we were P1 was a real surprise, but I was so chuffed with it. It was probably one of the most exhilarating laps of my life, an awesome experience in front of this amazing crowd.”
  Verstappen, who is third in this year’s drivers’ title race behind the McLaren pair Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, shook hands with Russell to congratulate him, but will harbour hopes of claiming an unprecedented fourth consecutive Canadian win.
  Last year, Russell led from pole for 20 laps before pitting to hand the lead to Norris for five laps until he also pitted. Verstappen then took control to win ahead of Norris with Russell coming home third.
  “I’m very happy with what we have achieved to be on the front row,” said Verstappen, having claimed Red Bull’s 200th front row start. “Tomorrow, we can have a solid race. We did the right thing with the tyres.”

  ‘Childish, annoying’  
  Asked about starting alongside Russell, the champion refused to comment, showing real irritation about the speculation on penalty points and bans.
  “I’m not talking about it anymore,” he said, having already confirmed he would not change his aggressive style.
  “It’s a waste of time to discuss this. It’s so childish and it is really annoying.”
  Russell’s sixth career pole confirmed Mercedes’ potential for success at the high-speed Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.
  The late-session drama lifted the oft-warring pair clear of championship leader Piastri and Kimi Antonelli in the second Mercedes.
  Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton was fifth for Ferrari ahead of two-time champion Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin, Norris in the second McLaren and Charles Leclerc in the second Ferrari.
  Impressive rookie Isack Hadjar was ninth for Racing Bulls and Alex Albon 10th for Williams.
  Piastri, who leads Norris by 10 points in the title race after nine of this year’s 24 races, was happy to recover form after a difficult practice.
  “To be honest, after how practice went, I am pretty happy,” he said. “We chose to go with softs ... We wanted to keep it safe.” — AFP

Mercedes’ George Russell grabbed a dazzling pole position and then enjoyed cracking a joke at rival Max Verstappen’s expense today after clocking a sensational lap in qualifying for tomorrow’s Canadian Grand Prix.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Pope Leo, a native of Chicago's south side and a long-time fan of his beloved but beleaguered White Sox, sent a video message on Saturday to a sellout crowd attending Catholic Mass in his honor at their hometown ballpark.
  The pontiff, the first leader of the global Catholic Church from the United States, appeared for about seven minutes on Rate Field's jumbotron during the event, organized by the Chicago archdiocese and featuring several other local personalities, including Bulls announcer Chuck Swirsky.
  "It's a pleasure for me to greet all of you gathered together at White Sox Park on this great celebration," the pope said in the video message, his first public address to the U.S.since his election on May 8 to replace the late Pope Francis.
  The new pope called on Chicagoans to put aside "egotistical ways" in order to spread hope and work to build community in their hometown.
  "We have to look for ways of coming together and promoting a message of hope," he said, speaking in English with a slight Chicago accent.   Hours before the event at Rate Field started, people had gathered around the stadium, including kids in White Sox jerseys, hawkers selling "Da Pope" baseball hats, nuns in white and blue habits and priests in their collars.
  Saturday's event, led by Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich, took place as demonstrations were held in cities across the U.S., including at Chicago's Daley Plaza, to protest President Donald Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants, and in Washington, D.C., ahead of the president celebrating his 79th birthday with a military parade.
  The pope did not mention politics, and instead offered a message of encouragement to young people.
  Sister Barbara Reid, president of the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, where the pope attended seminary in the 1980s, told Reuters she hoped his message could help unite the U.S.
  "A celebration that's centered on hope and possibility and unity is needed now more than ever before," she said. "Hopefully this can be a catalyst to bring us together."
  Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, was born in Dolton, on the outskirts of the city's south side, and has spent most of his career as a priest outside the U.S. He is a member of the Augustinian religious order, and spent decades in Peru as a missionary and bishop, before first taking up a senior Vatican role in 2023.    In a nod to Leo's close ties to the South American country, his celebration in Chicago on Saturday began with a performance of Peru's national anthem. The U.S. national anthem followed, performed by Leo High School's choir, which was a contestant on "America's Got Talent." 
  The pope's family, including a brother who still lives in a Chicago suburb, has spoken about the pontiff's enthusiasm for the White Sox, even as the rival Chicago Cubs also tried to claim him. Leo briefly donned the trademark black-and-white Sox cap offered by a pilgrim during his weekly audience in St. Peter's Square on Wednesday.
  TICKETS RESELL FOR MORE THAN $1,200
  On the first day that tickets became available for Saturday's event, more than 10,000 tickets were sold in the first 15 minutes, the White Sox said.
  Tickets, which sold for $5 apiece, hit resale sites like StubHub for more than $1,200 just hours after they were released, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.   While Catholic parishes across the city, including the one where the Prevost family attended Mass, have shuttered amid waning church attendance, Chicago's identity is still very much entwined with the Catholic Church. When meeting strangers, Chicagoans sometimes identify their neighborhood by the name of the closest parish.
  "A lot of people in Chicago just have great pride that the new pope is from Chicago," said Rev. Tom McCarthy, a popular preacher from the city who is also an Augustinian. "They want to celebrate it together."
  The White Sox (39-121) set the modern-day record for most losses in a single season in 2024. This year, the team has the worst record in the American League so far.
  Fans pray the Mass gives the team a divine boost.
  "We need all the help we can get," said McCarthy, a lifelong Sox fan. "If the field is going to be blessed by this event, hopefully it will go right through to the players."

LONDON -Bath coach Johann van Graan praised the togetherness of his club after they beat Leicester 23-21 to win the Premiership title for the first time since 1996 on Saturday, three years after finishing bottom of the league.
  The South African oversaw the turnaround that took Bath to the final last year, before finishing the regular season 11 points clear this year and holding off a late fightback from old rivals Leicester to secure a memorable triumph in the final.
  "It's for every player, every staff member, everyone involved in the club, and especially the supporters," Van Graan said. "We spoke about connection and what I saw before the game when we got off that bus was one of the best experiences I’ve had in the game."
  The victory completed a superb treble this season after Bath earlier bagged the Premiership Cup and European Challenge Cup.
  "Winning the Challenge Cup was brilliant but at the start of the year the goal was to win the Premiership," said flyhalf Finn Russell.
  "It's special. This group, the city, the club deserves it. The work we've put in over the last few years and then what we do on the pitch is try to represent the city as best we can.
  "After last year's defeat, we bounced back really quickly and we managed to get the job done."
  Russell looked certain to score an interception try in the second half but then threw a pass to supporting Max Ojomoh, drawing gasps from the astonished Twickenham crowd.
  "He's a kid from Bath that grew up watching his dad (England and Bath flanker Steve) lifting this trophy, Russell said. "Giving him a little bit of limelight in the final was nice."
  Veteran scrumhalf Ben Spencer, a title winner with Saracens, said: "What we've done this year, to win three trophies like we have, is unbelievable.
  "When Johann came in, he completely turned this place around. We've got a really good group around him in terms of coaches, in terms of staff and we've gone from there and I think we've gone from strength to strength.
  "I'm not sure there’s enough time to say what he brings. 
  He has an unbelievable ability to stay calm at all times. At halftime he’s great and we’ve had a really good ability to start from zero.
  "His ability to deal with people - 60-odd players who want to play every week - is amazing. The togetherness and strength of this group is just that - the group."
  Leicester coach Michael Cheika was proud of his team's effort but, not for the first time, was unhappy with the officials, who heavily penalised his team and sent two players to the sin bin.
  "The calls through the game went against us, the scrum calls were incredible, honestly, and some of the foul play ones. Dominating like that and getting nothing," said the Australian as his one-season stint came to a frustrating end. 
  "Of course I'm slightly biased, but it was frustrating and when you come out of a final having scored more tries than the opposition it says something.
  "But I love this group of guys, and love the club and I’m so proud of the players for the way they came in there and stayed in it right to the end. We gave ourselves a chance to win it right at the end, but unfortunately it didn’t go our way."

Iran announced a ‘new wave’ of attacks targeting Israel last night. (AP pic)
TEHRAN
:
Iran activated its air defences in several regions yesterday and Israel told its citizens to take shelter ahead of a fresh barrage of missiles, as the arch-foes exchanged massive strikes in their fiercest direct confrontation in history.
The fresh attacks came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to hit “every target of the Ayatollah regime”, and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned further strikes would draw “a more severe and powerful response”.
As calls for de-escalation grew, a new round of nuclear talks between the US and Iran scheduled for today was cancelled, with Iran saying it could not negotiate while under attack from Israel.
Israel’s operation, which began early Friday, has targeted Iran’s air defences and hit key nuclear and military sites, killing dozens of people including top army commanders and atomic scientists, according to Tehran.
Last night Israel said it was simultaneously working to intercept a new salvo of missiles fired from Iran, while also carrying out strikes on “military targets in Tehran”.
The Israeli military told citizens to heed air alerts and “enter a protected space and remain there until further notice”.
Iran, meanwhile, announced a “new wave” of attacks targeting Israel.
Tehran’s UN ambassador said 78 people were killed and 320 wounded in Friday’s first wave of Israeli strikes.
Israel said three people were killed and 76 wounded by Iran’s retaliatory drone and missile barrage overnight, which lit up the skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
Netanyahu vowed to keep up Israel’s campaign.
“We will hit every site, every target of the Ayatollah regime,” he said in a video statement, threatening greater action “in the coming days”.
He added that the Israeli campaign had dealt a “real blow” to Iran’s nuclear programme and maintained it had the “clear support” of US President Donald Trump.
Netanyahu’s defence minister, Israel Katz, warned “Tehran will burn” if it kept targeting Israeli civilians.
Israel’s fire service reported residential buildings were hit following the latest launches.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian fired back that “the continuation of the Zionist aggression will be met with a more severe and powerful response from the Iranian armed forces”.
According to a statement from his office, Pezeshkian also condemned Washington’s “dishonesty” for supporting Israel while engaged in nuclear talks with Iran – which mediator Oman said would no longer take place today.
Western governments have repeatedly accused Iran of seeking a nuclear weapon, which it denies.
Iran’s top nuclear negotiator, foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, said the Israeli attacks undermined negotiations and were pushing the region into a “dangerous cycle of violence”.
Foreign concern

With world leaders seeking to contain the conflict, Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed in a phone call that it needed to stop.
“He feels, as do I, this war in Israel-Iran should end,” Trump said on Truth Social.
After decades of enmity and conflict by proxy, it is the first time the arch-enemies have traded fire with such intensity, triggering fears of a prolonged conflict that could engulf the Middle East.
Highlighting the unease, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned against a “devastating war” with regional consequences in a call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Ankara said.
Israeli strikes have hit Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment plant and killed its highest-ranking military officer, Mohammad Bagheri, as well as the head of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami.
The Israeli military said its strikes had killed more than 20 Iranian commanders.
Iranian media reported five Guards killed yesterday in Israeli strikes, while authorities in one northwestern province said 30 military personnel had been killed there since Friday.
Iran called on its citizens to unite in the country’s defence, while Netanyahu urged them to rise against the government.
Iran’s Mehr news agency said Tehran had warned Britain, France and the US it could retaliate if they came to Israel’s defence.
‘Everything was shaking’
AFP images from the city of Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv showed blown-out buildings, destroyed vehicles and streets strewn with debris after Iran’s first wave of attacks.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said they had struck dozens of targets in Israel.
One Iranian missile wounded seven Israeli soldiers, the military said.
Firefighters had worked for hours to free people trapped in a Tel Aviv high-rise building on Friday.
Chen Gabizon, a resident, said he ran to an underground shelter after receiving an alert.
“We just heard a very big explosion, everything was shaking, smoke, dust, everything was all over the place,” he said.
In Tehran, fire and heavy smoke billowed over Mehrabad airport yesterday, an AFP journalist said.
The Israeli army said it had struck an underground military facility yesterday in western Iran’s Khorramabad that contained surface-to-surface and cruise missiles.
Iranian media also reported a “massive explosion” following an Israeli drone strike on an oil refinery in the southern city of Kangan.
The attacks prompted several countries to temporarily ground air traffic, though yesterday Jordan, Lebanon and Syria reopened their airspace.
Iran’s airspace was closed until further notice, state media reported, as was Israel’s, according to authorities.

LONDON
:
Britain is deploying fighter jets and other “assets” to the Middle East amid an escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said yesterday.
“We are moving assets to the region, including jets, and that is for contingency support,” Starmer told reporters travelling with him on his plane to Canada for G7 talks.
The UK leader said he had spoken with both US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since Israel launched attacks on Iranian military and nuclear sites early Friday.
According to officials, dozens of people have been killed, including top army and Revolutionary Guards commanders as well as civilians.
Iran has responded with barrages of drones and missiles fired at Israel overnight Friday into yesterday.
Starmer said the situation was “fast-moving” and “intense”.
“We’re having ongoing discussions with our allies all of the time, both myself and (foreign minister) David Lammy… who also spoke to the Iranians,” he said.
“Our constant message is de-escalate, and therefore everything we’re doing, all discussions we’re having are to do with de-escalation.”
The UK leader said his talk on Friday with Netanyahu had been “good and constructive” and had “included discussions about the safety and security of Israel”.
Foreign secretary Lammy said earlier yesterday that he was “alarmed” by further strikes overnight.
“We must urgently de-escalate & prevent any further harm to civilians,” Lammy said in a post on social media, adding that he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi “to urge calm”.

TEL AVIV: Iran ‘menghantar’ puluhan peluru berpandu ke atas Israel awal pagi semalam, sebagai tindak balas terhadap serangan besar-besaran yang menyasarkan kemudahan nuklear dan ketenteraan di negara republik Islam itu. Siren amaran serangan udara dan letupan kedengaran di seluruh Israel, dengan tentera menggesa penduduk untuk bersembunyi di tempat perlindungan bawah tanah. Tentera Israel mendakwa, puluhan peluru berpandu dilancarkan oleh Iran dalam gelombang kedua serangan balas tersebut, dengan sebahagiannya berjaya dipintas sistem pertahanan udara rejim, termasuk Iron Dome.

TEHERAN:  Israel dan Iran telah melakukan gelombang baru serangan ke atas bandar-bandar utama, mencetuskan kebimbangan perang berterusan habis-habisan, dengan kedua-dua pihak bertukar-tukar serangan yang kini memasuki hari ketiga.
  Peluru berpandu Iran menyerang utara Israel, membunuh sekurang-kurangnya tiga orang dan mencederakan 13 yang lain, lewat Sabtu hingga Ahad, menurut media Israel.
  Israel menyasarkan ibu pejabat Kementerian Pertahanan Iran di Teheran awal Ahad, menurut agensi berita separuh rasmi Tasnim.
  Pegawai Iran juga berkata, depot minyak Shahran, di barat laut Tehran, telah diserang oleh Israel.
  Tasnim News berkata, pasukan operasi dan penyelamat tiba di tempat kejadian dan masih berusaha untuk memadamkan kebakaran.
  Saluran 13 Israel melaporkan bahawa peluru berpandu mengenai Haifa dan Tamra.
  Serangan ke atas Haifa telah dijangka secara meluas, kerana bandar pantai itu menempatkan infrastruktur gas strategik.
  Penganalisis berpendapat ini menandakan permulaan pembalasan yang dijanjikan Iran untuk pengeboman Israel ke atas tapak tenaga utama berhampiran Bushehr dan Abadan.
  Walaupun sokongan awam meluas untuk tindakan ketenteraan terhadap Iran, ramai rakyat Israel masih ragu-ragu.
  Bercakap kepada Al Jazeera, penganalisis politik Israel, Ori Goldberg berkata terdapat kebimbangan dan ketidakpercayaan yang semakin meningkat dalam kalangan penduduk.
  “Terdapat sokongan besar-besaran untuk ‘mengajar’ Iran – itu naratif rasmi,” katanya.
  “Tetapi orang ramai tidak percaya serangan ini akan memusnahkan program nuklear Iran atau membawa perubahan rejim. Mereka mula berjuang sendiri.”
  Goldberg menambah bahawa ramai yang mengesyaki motif politik di sebalik kempen itu, mencadangkan pemimpin mungkin menggunakan krisis untuk meningkatkan kedudukan mereka.
  “Tiada kepercayaan terhadap keupayaan kerajaan untuk melindungi orang awam,” katanya. “Orang ramai berasa ditinggalkan.”
  Berikutan serangan Israel ke atas Iran, wartawan Al Jazeera di Teheran berkata, asap kelihatan naik dari depoh minyak Shahran di Tehran berikutan serangan Israel, walaupun tahap keseluruhan kerosakan masih belum jelas.
  “Dikatakan pusat penyimpanan minyak menjadi sasaran, tetapi tahap kerosakan tidaklah seberapa,” lapornya.
  Beliau menambah bahawa pertahanan udara Iran telah diaktifkan di ibu negara sejurus selepas serangan itu.
  “Saya melihat pemintasan. Bunyi letupan kedengaran,” katanya.
  Wartawan terbabit menyifatkan pengeboman berterusan Israel ke atas tapak nuklear, tentera dan awam di seluruh Iran sebagai “belum pernah berlaku sebelum ini”, memberi amaran bahawa perkembangan itu mungkin akan mencetuskan peningkatan selanjutnya. – Al Jazeera

TEHRAN: Seorang pegawai kanan keselamatan Iran telah memberitahu Al Jazeera bahawa Tehran sedang bersedia untuk konfrontasi yang berpanjangan, dan akan meningkatkan serangannya.
  Pegawai itu bercakap dengan syarat tidak mahu namanya disiarkan, berkata bahawa Iran tidak memulakan perang, tetapi akan menentukan penamatnya.
  Konflik itu adalah perang Netanyahu, kata pegawai itu, dan hasilnya akan menjadi kemusnahan rejim Israel.
  Pegawai itu berkata bahawa Iran membela rakyatnya – dan Presiden AS Donald Trump perlu memutuskan sama ada akan membazirkan wang pembayar cukai Amerika untuk cita-cita Netanyahu. – Al Jazeera

（德黑兰15日讯）伊朗塔斯尼姆通讯社（Tasnim News Agency）报导，以色列今天的攻击导致全球最大
天然气田
发生火灾，部分生产被迫暂停。这也是以色列首次对伊朗油气产业发动攻击。
据外媒报导，南帕尔斯（South Pars）天然气田由伊朗与卡达共有，攻击气田代表冲突出现重大升级。尽管在攻击首日，以色列并未对伊朗的石油和天然气产业造成损害，但冲突已将13日的油价推高9%。

南帕尔斯气田位于伊朗南部布什尔省（Bushehr）近海，占伊朗天然气产量的大部分。伊朗是继美国和俄罗斯之后全球第3大天然气生产国。
据报导，以国的攻击在气田引发火灾，之后火灾已被扑灭。塔斯尼姆通讯社称，气田第14期的4个装置之一起火，导致1200万立方公尺的天然气暂停生产。
伊朗的天然气年产量约2750亿立方公尺，约占全球产量的6.5%。由于美国制裁导致伊朗天然气无法出口，这些天然气主要供国内消费。（ETToday新闻云）

发动称为“崛起雄狮”（Rising Lion）的突袭行动，攻击多个军事与核相关设施，并歼灭伊朗军方高层和核武科学家，引发伊朗多次向以色列发射导弹和火箭弹报复。以军在第2天持续向伊朗展开攻击，不仅空袭伊朗南部的天然气田，甚至空袭伊朗西部的导弹储藏库和取得制空权，同时放话“火烧德黑兰！”
根据伊朗半官方媒体《法斯通讯社》报道，位于伊朗地部波斯湾海域的南帕尔斯天然气田（South Par Gas Field）第14矿区精炼设施，因当地时间14日傍晚6时30分遭到以色列无人机空袭，导致天然气田燃起大火，由消防队持续进行灭火作业，现场甚至传出两次爆炸声响，目前天然气田生产暂时中断。

南帕尔斯天然气田是全球最大天然气田，占伊朗天然气产量的大部分，伊朗是继美国和俄罗斯之后的全球第3大天然气生产国。报道说，伊朗南部港品城市阿巴斯港的上空也侦测到不明飞行物体，已启动防空系统。
伊朗伊斯兰革命卫队（IRGC）防空部队卡塔姆安比亚指出，“过去1小时内，已在多个地区击落以色列10架军机。”
以色列国防军（IDF）发言人德弗林昨晚在记者会上说，“目前空军仍在伊朗各地实施袭击，造成相当程度的打击，已在40个小时内工作了超过150个目标。”
德弗林又说，以军已在13至14日晚间投入70架空军战机，在两个半小时内成功打击德黑兰防空系统和40个目标地点，“多亏消灭伊朗防空网的威胁，才能让数十架飞机在德黑兰上空飞翔。如今，德黑兰已沦为缺乏防御力量的城市，暴露在以军的攻击中。”
同时，以军以也在声明中说，以色列空军已在伊朗西部至伊朗首都德黑兰取得制空权，且成功空袭位于伊朗西部的地对地导弹、巡弋导弹储藏设施和发射台。
《以色列时报》报道，以色列国防部长卡茨在当地时14日警告伊朗最高精神领袖哈梅内伊，“如果哈梅内伊持续奥以色列境内发射导弹，德黑兰将会沦为火海！伊朗的独裁者持续绑架伊朗人民。要是伊朗持续向以色列民间人士进行犯罪性攻击，将得承受沉痛代价。”

ISTANBUL, June 15 (Bernama-Anadolu) -- Israeli airstrikes early on Sunday targeted the headquarters of Iran's Defence Ministry in the Iranian capital, Tehran, Anadolu Ajansi (AA) reported, citing the Iranian semi-official news agency Tasnim.
  The attacks targeted the Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics headquarters in the Nobonyad area, causing slight damage to an administrative building.
  There was no immediate comment from the Iranian Defence Ministry.
  In the early hours of Friday, Israeli forces attacked Iran, hitting nuclear and missile facilities and killing top military commanders and scientists.
  Iran responded with ballistic missiles targeting several areas across Israel, killing and injuring Israelis and damaging buildings.

TEHRAN, June 15 (Bernama-IRNA) -- Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says Riyadh believes the Israeli regime seeks to deepen the conflict with Iran in an attempt to drag the United States (US) into the war, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
  In a phone conversation with President Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday, the Saudi crown prince said Saudi Arabia was also confident that Iran would act prudently and thwart Tel Aviv’s goal.
  “Today, the entire Islamic world supports you in unison,” Mohammed bin Salman told the president.
  Pezeshkian said he had worked since his inauguration to strengthen peace, security, and stability in the region but Israel had sought to disrupt his agenda anytime he came close to achieving that goal.
  The president said he hoped Iran and Saudi Arabia could work together to fill the region with calm.
  The Israeli regime began strikes inside Iranian territory overnight on Friday. Air defence systems and nuclear energy sites were targeted in a first wave of strikes.
  Attacks also targeted top Iranian military officials. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio quickly announced that the United States had not been involved.
  Shortly afterwards, Iran began punitive strikes deep inside Israel, hitting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Iranian officials have said the mission will continue as long as necessary.
  On Saturday, Israel carried out at least two strikes on Iranian energy infrastructure, ratcheting up the war to a new level. Another major wave of punitive Iranian strikes is expected on Saturday night.

新华社报道，中共政治局委员、中国外交部长王毅昨天在听取萨尔说明以方对当前局势的看法和以色列的立场后，王毅表示，中方一贯主张任何国际争端都应通过对话协商予以解决，反对使用武力和制裁手段。
ADVERTISEMENT
中方明确反对以色列违反国际法以武力袭击伊朗，尤其是在国际社会仍在寻求政治解决伊朗核问题的情况下，这一行径更是不可接受的。
王毅指出，以色列、伊朗都是中东重要国家，以伊关系牵动中东战和全局。当务之急是立即采取措施避免冲突升级，防止地区陷入更大动荡，回归外交手段解决问题的轨道，这也是国际社会的普遍共识。
王毅也披露了同伊朗外长阿拉格齐通话的情况，强调中东不能永远处于冲突的阴影下，以色列也不应持续生活在战争的不安中。
王毅说，伊朗核问题的外交手段并未穷尽，和平解决仍有希望。武力无法带来持久和平，秉持共同安全理念才能彻底解决各方合理关切。
他表明，中方一贯从事情本身的是非曲直出发对待和处理地区热点问题，敦促以伊双方通过对话解决分歧，寻求和平共处之道。中方愿为此发挥建设性作用。
王毅希望以方切实维护好中国机构和人员的安全。新华社引述萨尔的话说，以方一贯重视并将继续维护中国机构和人员安全。
王毅与阿拉格齐通话时说，中方谴责以色列侵犯伊朗的主权、安全和领土完整，并说以色列对伊朗核设施的攻击可能造成灾难性后果。
根据中方新闻稿，阿拉格齐指出，以方军事行动高度危险，可能将整个地区拖入全面战争，希望国际社会发出要求以色列停止军事行动的一致声音。

世界各国领导人紧急呼吁缓和局势，避免全面战争。中国外长王毅说，对核设施的袭击开创了一个“危险的先例”。在经过20个月的战斗后，以色列再次努力消灭加沙地带由伊朗撑腰的织哈马斯，这一地区已经处于紧张状态。
以色列被普遍认为是中东地区唯一拥有核武器的国家。以色列说，以军过去两天对伊朗发动的数百次袭击已经造成多名高级将领、9名与伊朗核项目有关的高级科学家和专家死亡。伊朗驻联合国大使说，有78人死亡，320多人受伤。
美国情报机构和国际原子能机构（IAEA）一再表示，在以色列从周五起对伊朗发动空袭之前，伊朗并没有寻求发展核武器。
以色列总理涅坦雅胡把摧毁伊朗核项目作为首要任务。他表示，以色列迄今为止的袭击“与未来几天在我们军队的打击下他们将感受到的打击相比根本不算什么”。
据半官方的伊朗新闻机构报道，一架以色列无人机袭击了伊朗一家天然气加工厂，造成了“强烈爆炸”。如果得到证实，这可能是又一次升级。这将是以色列首次袭击伊朗的石油和天然气工业。以军没有立即发表评论。
目前尚不清楚南帕尔斯天然气田的受损程度。这些地点周围都有防空系统，以色列一直将其作为攻击目标。
调解方阿曼表示，星期日举行的第六轮美伊关于伊朗核计划的间接会谈将不会举行。“我们仍然致力于谈判，并希望伊朗方面能尽快坐下来谈判。”
伊朗宣称，其核项目仅用于和平目的。美国情报机构评估说，德黑兰并没有积极寻求制造核弹，但伊朗的铀浓缩已达到接近武器级别的水平。联合国原子能监督机构上周四谴责伊朗没有履行防止其发展核武器的义务。
伊朗外长阿格拉齐周六表示，在以色列发动袭击后，核谈判“毫无道理”。他在与欧盟最高外交官卡拉斯通话时发表上述言论。
他在伊朗国家通讯社IRNA发表的一份声明中表示，以色列的空袭是“华盛顿直接支持的结果”。美国已表示其并未参与此次袭击。
上周五，美国总统特朗普敦促伊朗就其核计划与美国达成协议，并补充说：“伊朗必须达成协议，否则就一无所有了。”
伊朗于上周五晚间和周六凌晨向以色列发射了第一波导弹。以色列称，袭击造成至少3人死亡，174人受伤，其中2人伤势严重。军方表示，一枚导弹击中以色列中部，造成7名士兵轻伤，但未具体说明具体位置。
一位不愿透露姓名的美国官员表示，美国在该地区的陆基防空系统正协助击落伊朗导弹。

以色列主要国际机场表示，将继续关闭，直至另行通知。
以色列应急人员正在寻找幸存者，并清理星期日凌晨落在特拉维夫郊外一个街区的导弹残骸。
一位美联社记者见到街道两旁尽是受损和被毁的建筑物、被炸毁的汽车和玻璃碎片。
救援人员在一些难以进入的地区使用无人机搜寻幸存者。一些人带着行李箱逃离该地区。
以色列袭击了伊朗位于纳坦兹的主要核浓缩设施。美联社分析的卫星照片显示，该设施遭到严重破坏。Planet Labs PBC周六拍摄的图像显示，多座建筑物受损或被毁。被击中的建筑物包括专家确认为该设施供电的建筑物。
IAEA负责人格罗西告诉联合国安理会，纳坦兹设施的地面部分已被摧毁。他表示，地下的主要离心机设施似乎没有受到袭击，但断电可能导致当地的基础设施损坏。
以色列还袭击了位于伊斯法罕的一个核研究设施，包括“浓缩铀转化基础设施”，并摧毁了伊朗西部数十座雷达装置和地对空导弹发射器。伊朗证实了对伊斯法罕的袭击。
IAEA表示，伊斯法罕核电站的四座“关键建筑”遭到破坏，其中包括铀转化设施。该机构补充道：“与纳坦兹核电站一样，预计场外辐射水平不会增加。”
一位根据官方程序不愿透露姓名的以军官员表示，根据军方的初步评估，伊朗修复纳坦兹和伊斯法罕核设施的损坏“将耗时远不止几周”。这位官员表示，军方掌握“确凿情报，表明伊斯法罕的生产活动用于军事目的”。
以色列否认袭击了位于德黑兰东南约100公里的福尔多核浓缩设施。
遇难者包括三名伊朗高级军事领导人，即伊朗武装部队参谋总长巴盖里、伊斯兰革命卫队总司令，以及以及负责监管其弹道导弹计划的革命卫队航空航天部门负责人哈吉扎德。上周六，伊朗最高领导人哈梅内伊任命了穆萨维掌管该部门。

伊朗导弹多数落在以色列城市内部，以色列指控伊朗蓄意锁定平民区；目前不清楚是否有敏感的军事或基础设施受袭。截至周六清晨，以色列一个热门娱乐区的住宅大楼遭飞弹击中，这里靠近特拉维夫主要军事与政府总部，因此可能被视为主要目标。
以色列国土面积不大，仅略大于美国新泽西州，大多数人口集中在拥挤的沿海平原地区。以军在市区与偏远地区均设有军营与基地。
以军一直打击伊朗的导弹库存与发射器。
根据军事官员与专家评估，伊朗仍有数百枚飞弹，甚至达到2000枚，射程可到达以色列境内。如果伊朗持续以目前速度发射飞弹，预计还能再维持数日的攻击强度。
另一方面，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）引述白宫和以色列官员的话说，以色列对伊朗的行动预计将持续数周，并非数日，且是在美国默许之下持续推进。一名以色列官员向CNN透露，美国总统特朗普政府在私下的讨论之中，并未对可能长达数周的行动时间表提出批评。
白宫官员表示，美国政府知情且默许以色列行动计划。当被问及这场冲突将会持续多久时，官员表示，这将取决于伊朗的反应。
以色列航空暨飞弹专家塔尔因巴尔表示，伊朗这次反击与过去最大的不同在于，伊朗同时大规模发射多枚导弹，试图突破以色列防空系统的拦截能力，而且命中地点多为人口稠密区域，光是导弹冲击波就已造成严重损害。
此外，以军昨天公布影像显示，伊朗这次使用过去未曾用来对付以色列的导弹，名为“烈士苏莱曼尼”（Shahed Haj Qassem），射程接近1600公里。这款导弹采用固体燃料推进，不需在发射前加注燃料，能长期储存在地下，一经命令即可于数分钟内发射，大幅提升伊朗的战备反应能力。

ISTANBUL, June 15 (Bernama-Anadolu) -- Iraq on Saturday formally requested the United States (US) to prevent Israeli aircraft from using its airspace to target Iran, Anadolu Ajansi (AA) reported, citing local media.
  “Iraq has asked the United States to take its role in preventing Israeli aircraft from violating Iraqi airspace in accordance with the Strategic Framework Agreement,” the Iraqi News Agency reported, citing a government source.
  The source stressed the importance of respecting Iraq’s sovereignty and the integrity of its airspace, adding that “the US, as the country leading the international coalition against ISIS, is obliged to uphold its responsibilities and prevent any violations that compromise Iraqi sovereignty or endanger its security.”
  Israel launched a series of strikes against Iranian territory, targeting nuclear and missile facilities early on Friday, killing senior military figures and scientists.

------------------------------
TEL AVIV, June 15 — Israel and Iran launched fresh attacks on each other overnight into today, stoking fears of a wider conflict after Israel expanded its surprise campaign against its main rival with a strike on the world’s biggest gas field.
  Tehran called off nuclear talks that Washington had said were the only way to halt Israel’s bombing, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were nothing compared with what Iran would see in the coming days.
  Israel’s military said more missiles were launched from Iran towards Israel overnight, and that it was attacking military targets in Tehran.
  Early this morning, air raid sirens blared across Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Several missiles were seen streaking through the sky over Tel Aviv, while interceptor rockets were launched from the ground. Explosions echoed in both cities.

  Israel’s ambulance service said three women were killed and 10 other people injured in an earlier missile strike near a house in northern Israel. Emergency responders with flashlights were seen searching the rubble of the partially collapsed home in Tamra, a predominantly Palestinian city.
  Around 2.30am local time, the Israeli military warned of another barrage launched from Iran and urged the public to seek shelter. By 3.30am, at least four people had been killed and 36 were reported injured in multiple overnight missile attacks. Israeli media published an image of a 10-story residential building, reportedly in central Israel, showing extensive damage after a strike.
  Iran said the Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack but that the situation was under control, and that a fire had erupted after an Israeli attack on an oil refinery near the capital. Israeli strikes also targeted Iran’s defence ministry building in Tehran, causing minor damage, Iran’s Tasnim news agency said today.
  Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said Iranian missiles and drones targeted Israel’s energy infrastructure and facilities for fighter jet fuel production. The elite force warned Tehran’s attacks will be “heavier and more extensive” if Israel continues its hostilities.
  US President Donald Trump had warned Iran of worse to come, but said it was not too late to halt the Israeli campaign if Tehran accepted a sharp downgrading of its nuclear programme.
  A round of US-Iran nuclear talks that was due to be held in Oman today was cancelled, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi saying the discussions could not take place while Iran was being subjected to Israel’s “barbarous” attacks.
  In the first apparent attack to hit Iran’s energy infrastructure, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said Iran partially suspended production at the world’s biggest gas field after an Israeli strike caused a fire there yesterday.
  The South Pars field, offshore in Iran’s southern Bushehr province, is the source of most of the gas produced in Iran.
  Fears about potential disruption to the region’s oil exports had already driven up oil prices 9 per cent on Friday even though Israel spared Iran’s oil and gas on the first day of its attacks.
  An Iranian general, Esmail Kosari, said yesterday that Tehran was reviewing whether to close the Strait of Hormuz controlling access to the Gulf for tankers.
  A fire blazes in the oil depots of Shahran, north-west of Tehran, on June 15, 2025.

  Iran says scores killed 
  Iran said 78 people were killed on the first day of Israel’s campaign, and scores more on the second, including 60 when a missile brought down a 14-storey apartment block in Tehran, where 29 of the dead were children.
  Iran had launched its own retaliatory missile volley on Friday night, killing at least three people in Israel.
  With Israel saying its operation could last weeks, and Netanyahu urging Iran’s people to rise up against their Islamic clerical rulers, fears have grown of a regional conflagration dragging in outside powers.
  B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights organization, said yesterday that instead of exhausting all possibilities for a diplomatic resolution, Israel’s government had chosen to start a war that puts the entire region in danger.
  Tehran has warned Israel’s allies that their military bases in the region would come under fire too if they helped shoot down Iranian missiles.
  However, 20 months of war in Gaza and a conflict in Lebanon last year have decimated Tehran’s strongest regional proxies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, reducing its options for retaliation.

（德黑兰15日讯）伊朗塔斯尼姆通讯社（Tasnim News Agency）报导，以色列今天的攻击导致全球最大天然气田发生火灾，部分生产被迫暂停。这也是以色列首次对伊朗油气产业发动攻击。
据外媒报导，南帕尔斯（South Pars）天然气田由伊朗与卡达共有，攻击气田代表冲突出现重大升级。尽管在攻击首日，以色列并未对伊朗的石油和天然气产业造成损害，但冲突已将13日的油价推高9%。

南帕尔斯气田位于伊朗南部布什尔省（Bushehr）近海，占伊朗天然气产量的大部分。伊朗是继美国和俄罗斯之后全球第3大天然气生产国。
据报导，以国的攻击在气田引发火灾，之后火灾已被扑灭。塔斯尼姆通讯社称，气田第14期的4个装置之一起火，导致1200万立方公尺的天然气暂停生产。

伊朗的天然气年产量约2750亿立方公尺，约占全球产量的6.5%。由于美国制裁导致伊朗天然气无法出口，这些天然气主要供国内消费。（ETToday新闻云）

的“全面打击”，并重申华盛顿与以色列袭击德黑兰核设施和情报设施“无关”。
据德黑兰宣称，以色列从上周五上午开始的袭击行动，目标是伊朗的核设施和军事设施，造成数十人死亡，其中包括高级军队指挥官和原子科学家。

以色列总理涅坦雅胡誓言要打击“阿亚图拉政权的每一个目标”，而伊朗则以致命的导弹攻击进行报复。
尽管特朗普曾表示，他在以色列的行动开始之前就已知悉，但他星期日上午在自己的“真相社交”平台上重申，美国“与今晚对伊朗的袭击无关”。
他在一篇帖子中说：“如果我们受到伊朗以任何方式、形式或形式的攻击，美国武装部队的全部力量和威力将以前所未有的水平打击你们。”
他补充说，“我们可以很容易地在伊朗和以色列之间达成协议，结束这场血腥的冲突！！”
上周五，特朗普敦促德黑兰达成协议，否则将面临以色列“更残酷”的袭击。
在特朗普第一任期内，一项由前总统奥巴马执政期间谈判达成、具有里程碑意义的伊朗核协议，在2018年因特朗普单方面宣布美国退出伊核协议并重新实施制裁而受阻。
与此同时，伊朗学生新闻网星期日报道，德黑兰炼油厂的燃料生产、供应和分配仍在继续，并未中断。此前，以色列的袭击导致一个与炼油厂无关的油罐在夜间发生大火。

JERUSALEM
:
Waves of overnight Iranian strikes on Israel killed at least eight people, including children, according to emergency services, after air raid sirens sent millions across the country scrambling into shelters.
In the central region, at least four people, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed and around 100 others wounded in a rocket strike, according to a spokesman for Magen David Adom (MDA).
In Shfela region, another 37 people were wounded, the spokesman added.
The Israeli police confirmed in a post on X that a strike along the central coast in Tel Aviv district killed several people and wounded dozens more.
After an earlier strike destroyed a three-storey building in Israel’s Western Galilee region late yesterday, MDA said three women were killed.
“Two women were rescued without signs of life, and their deaths were pronounced at the scene,” the emergency service said in a statement.
A third woman died at hospital, it said.
Emergency services said an Iranian missile hit a home in the Haifa region yesterday, killing a woman in her 20s and wounding 14 others.
An MDA spokesman told Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 that around 200 people were wounded in overnight missile strikes fired by Iran.
Last night, Israel said it was simultaneously working to intercept a barrage of missiles fired from Iran, while also carrying out strikes on Tehran.

CAIRO
:
Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis said today that they targeted Israel in coordination with Iran, the first time an Iran-aligned group has publicly announced joint cooperation on attacks with Tehran.
The Yemeni group targeted central Israel’s Jaffa with several ballistic missiles in the last 24 hours, military spokesman Yehya Sarea said in a televised address.
“Triumphing for the oppressed Palestinian and Iranian peoples…This operation was coordinated with the operations carried out by the Iranian army against the criminal Israeli enemy,” he added.
The Israeli military earlier said sirens were activated in several areas in the country following missile launches from Iran and Yemen.
Israel and Iran continued to exchange missile attacks since Israel launched its biggest-ever military strike against its longstanding enemy on Friday.
On the same day Israel launched its attack on Iran, Israel said a missile that was launched from Yemen towards Israel fell in Hebron in the occupied West Bank. The Yemeni group however did not claim responsibility for the missile launch.
The Houthis have been launching attacks against Israel, most of which have been intercepted, in what they say is support for Palestinians in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war there since Hamas’s Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
Israel has carried out a series of retaliatory strikes.
The US also launched intensified strikes against the Houthis this year, before president Donald Trump halted the offensive after the Houthis agreed to stop attacks on American ships.

（德黑兰15日综合电）以色列向伊朗发动称为“崛起雄狮”（Rising Lion）的突袭行动，攻击多个军事与核相关设施，并歼灭伊朗军方高层和核武科学家，引发伊朗多次向以色列发射导弹和火箭弹报复。以军在第2天持续向伊朗展开攻击，不仅空袭伊朗南部的天然气田，甚至空袭伊朗西部的导弹储藏库和取得制空权，同时放话“火烧德黑兰！”
根据伊朗半官方媒体《法斯通讯社》报道，位于伊朗地部波斯湾海域的南帕尔斯天然气田（South Par Gas Field）第14矿区精炼设施，因当地时间14日傍晚6时30分遭到以色列无人机空袭，导致天然气田燃起大火，由消防队持续进行灭火作业，现场甚至传出两次爆炸声响，目前天然气田生产暂时中断。

南帕尔斯天然气田是全球最大天然气田，占伊朗天然气产量的大部分，伊朗是继美国和俄罗斯之后的全球第3大天然气生产国。报道说，伊朗南部港品城市阿巴斯港的上空也侦测到不明飞行物体，已启动防空系统。
伊朗伊斯兰革命卫队（IRGC）防空部队卡塔姆安比亚指出，“过去1小时内，已在多个地区击落以色列10架军机。”

以色列国防军（IDF）发言人德弗林昨晚在记者会上说，“目前空军仍在伊朗各地实施袭击，造成相当程度的打击，已在40个小时内工作了超过150个目标。”

德弗林又说，以军已在13至14日晚间投入70架空军战机，在两个半小时内成功打击德黑兰防空系统和40个目标地点，“多亏消灭伊朗防空网的威胁，才能让数十架飞机在德黑兰上空飞翔。如今，德黑兰已沦为缺乏防御力量的城市，暴露在以军的攻击中。”


同时，以军以也在声明中说，以色列空军已在伊朗西部至伊朗首都德黑兰取得制空权，且成功空袭位于伊朗西部的地对地导弹、巡弋导弹储藏设施和发射台。

《以色列时报》报道，以色列国防部长卡茨在当地时14日警告伊朗最高精神领袖哈梅内伊，“如果哈梅内伊持续奥以色列境内发射导弹，德黑兰将会沦为火海！伊朗的独裁者持续绑架伊朗人民。要是伊朗持续向以色列民间人士进行犯罪性攻击，将得承受沉痛代价。”

[,  ] 
PAS secretary-general Takiyuddin Hassan has strongly condemned Israel’s recent assault on Iran, describing it as a deliberate attempt to sabotage all efforts toward a diplomatic resolution of the ongoing Middle East conflict.

In a statement today, Takiyuddin warned that the latest aggression risks escalating tensions in the region while exposing Israel’s hegemonic ambitions.
------------------------------
DUBAI (Reuters): Iran does not want its conflict with Israel to expand to neighbouring countries unless the situation is forced, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Sunday (June 15), adding its response had been based on self-defence.
  Araqchi said Tehran had been responding to foreign aggression and that if this aggression stopped, Iranian reactions would also cease.
  The foreign minister said the Israeli strikes on the offshore South Pars gas field Iran shares with Qatar were "a blatant aggression and a very dangerous act".
  "Dragging the conflict to the Persian Gulf is a strategic mistake, and its aim is to drag the war beyond Iranian territory," he said.
  The foreign minister accused Israel of seeking to sabotage ongoing Iran-United States nuclear talks, which according to him could have opened the way for an agreement. Tehran was set to present a proposal this Sunday during a sixth round of talks, which were cancelled following recent escalations.
  "Israel's attack would never have happened without the US green light and support," Araqchi said, adding Tehran does not believe American statements that Washington had taken no part in recent attacks.
  "It is necessary for the United States to condemn Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities if they want to prove their goodwill."
  Meanwhile, Israel issued an evacuation warning to Iranians residing near weapons facilities in Iran, an Israeli military spokesperson said in a post on X in Arabic and Farsi.
  The spokesperson said the evacuation warning includes all weapons factories and supporting facilities.
  Trump weighs in 
  US President Donald Trump said the conflict could be easily ended while warning Tehran not to strike any US targets.
  Israeli rescue teams combed through the rubble of residential buildings destroyed in strikes, using flashlights and sniffer dogs to look for survivors after at least 10 people, including children, were killed, authorities said.
  The Israeli military warned Iranians living near nuclear reactors to evacuate, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks by Israel so far were nothing compared with what Iran would see in the coming days.
  "If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before," Trump said in a message on Truth Social. "However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict."
  Trump gave no details of any possible deal.
  Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Israel's attacks, which began on Friday, were aimed at sabotaging the nuclear talks with the United States. that were to resume in Oman on Sunday. He said Israel's attacks had the support of the United States and that Iran was acting only in self-defence.
  Israel has said the campaign's goal is to stop Iran from developing atomic weapons and taking out its ballistic missile capabilities. Officials have acknowledged the military strikes were unlikely to fully halt Iran's nuclear programme and voiced hopes they would lead to a comprehensive US-Iran deal.
  Araqchi has previously said the Oman talks could not take place while Iran was being subjected to Israel's "barbarous" attacks.
  Iran has said 78 people were killed there on the first day of Israel's campaign, and scores more on the second, including 60 when a missile brought down a 14-storey apartment block in Tehran, where 29 of the dead were children.
  The Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack, Iran said, but added the situation was under control. A fire had erupted after an Israeli attack on an oil refinery near the capital while Israeli strikes also targeted Iran's defence ministry building, causing minor damage, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said on Sunday.
  In Israel, the latest wave of Iranian attacks began shortly after 11pm on Saturday (2000 GMT), when air raid sirens blared in Jerusalem and Haifa, sending around a million people into bomb shelters.
  Around 2.30am local time (2330 GMT Saturday), the Israeli military warned of another incoming missile barrage and urged residents to seek shelter. Explosions echoed through Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as missiles streaked across the skies as interceptor rockets were launched in response. The military lifted its shelter-in-place advisory nearly an hour after issuing the warning.
  Houthis attack Israel 
  Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis said on Sunday they targeted central Israel's Jaffa with several ballistic missiles in the last 24 hours, the first time an ally of Iran has joined the fray.
  Tehran has warned Israel's allies that their military bases in the region would come under fire too if they helped shoot down Iranian missiles.
  However, 20 months of war in Gaza and a conflict in Lebanon last year have decimated Tehran's strongest regional proxies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, reducing its options for retaliation.
  Israeli authorities said at least 10 people were killed overnight, including three children, and more than 140 injured by missiles that had hit homes in northern and central Israel.
  Israeli media said at least 35 people were missing after a strike hit Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. A spokesperson for the emergency services said a missile hit an 8-storey building there and while many people were rescued, there were fatalities.
  So far, at least 13 people in Israel have been killed and over 300 others injured since Iran launched its retaliatory attacks on Friday.
  In the first apparent attack to hit Iran's energy infrastructure, Tasnim news agency said Iran partially suspended production at South Pars, the world's biggest gas field, after an Israeli strike caused a fire there on Saturday.
  The South Pars field, offshore in Iran's southern Bushehr province, is the source of most of the gas produced in Iran.
  Fears about potential disruption to the region's oil exports had already driven up oil prices 9% on Friday even though Israel spared Iran's oil and gas on the first day of its attacks.
  Share markets in the region opened for the first time since the Israeli strikes, with Tel Aviv stocks down more than 1% and Saudi shares falling 3.6% in early trade.
  With Israel saying its operation could last weeks, and Netanyahu urging Iran's people to rise up against their Islamic clerical rulers, fears have grown of a regional conflagration dragging in outside powers.
  Israel sees Iran's nuclear programme as a threat to its existence, and said the bombardment was designed to avert the last steps to production of a nuclear weapon.
  Tehran insists the programme is entirely civilian and that it does not seek an atomic bomb. The UN nuclear watchdog, however, reported Iran this week as violating obligations under the global non-proliferation treaty. – Reuters

WASHINGTON, June 15 — Donald Trump warned Iran today that it would experience “the full strength” of the US military if it attacks the United States, reiterating that Washington “had nothing to do” with Israel’s strikes on Tehran’s nuclear and intelligence facilities.
  Israel’s operation, which began early Friday, has targeted Iranian nuclear and military sites, killing dozens of people including top army commanders and atomic scientists, according to Tehran.
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to hit “every target of the ayatollah regime”, and Iran has retaliated with a deadly barrage of missiles.
  While Trump had said he was aware of the Israeli operation before it started, he reiterated Sunday morning on his Truth Social platform that the United States “had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, tonight.”
  “If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before,” he said in a post.
  He added that “we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!”
  On Friday, the US president urged Tehran to make a deal or face “even more brutal” attacks by Israel.
  During his first term, a landmark nuclear accord with Iran — negotiated under former president Barack Obama — was torpedoed in 2018 when Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States and reimposed sanctions. — AFP

七大工业国集团（G7）
领袖今天在加拿大召开
高峰会议
。英国首相斯塔默在飞往加拿大时说，已和美国总统特朗普、以色列总理涅坦雅胡和其他世界领袖讨论降温局势的作法。
英国在向中东派遣皇家空军军机和其他军事增援。斯塔默说：“我们对伊朗拥有的核计划长期抱持担忧。我们确实承认以色列自卫权利，我绝对清楚现在局势需要降温。目前区域形势更广泛升级的危机很大”，也说预料G7峰会上将继续“激烈讨论”。

美联社报道，这次G7峰会受到中东战争扩大以及特朗普关税战悬而未决的阴影垄罩。以色列周五（13日）空袭伊朗核设施，以及德黑兰随后报复的行动，似乎让许多世界领袖措手不及，又一次显示随着特朗普希望让美国作为世界警察的角色退场，世界局势更不稳定。
另外，路透社报道，德国外交部长瓦德普尔昨晚向德国公共广播联盟ARD说，德国、法国和英国在准备好就德黑兰的核计划立刻与伊朗会谈，以期缓和中东形势。
在出访中东的瓦德福尔说，在设法协助以色列和伊朗冲突降温，并说德黑兰过去未能把握机会进入具建设性的会谈，“我希望那仍有可能”；德国和英、法都已准备好，“我们提议伊朗就核计划立即协商”，希望德黑兰接受。
瓦德普尔也说，这场冲突和解的一项关键先决条件，就是伊朗对中东、以色列和欧洲都不形成危险。
他又说，唯有各方都对伊朗、以色列施压，冲突才能结束，“目前共同预期是，未来一周内必须设法对双方采取认真行动，来打断暴力循环。”

TEHRAN, June 15 (Bernama-IRNA) -- Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says Riyadh believes the Israeli regime seeks to deepen the conflict with Iran in an attempt to drag the United States (US) into the war,the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
In a phone conversation with President Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday, the Saudi crown prince said Saudi Arabia was also confident that Iran would act prudently and thwart Tel Aviv’s goal.
“Today, the entire Islamic world supports you in unison,” Mohammed bin Salman told the president.

Pezeshkian said he had worked since his inauguration to strengthen peace, security, and stability in the region but Israel had sought to disrupt his agenda anytime he came close to achieving that goal.
The president said he hoped Iran and Saudi Arabia could work together to fill the region with calm.
The Israeli regime began strikes inside Iranian territory overnight on Friday. Air defence systems and nuclear energy sites were targeted in a first wave of strikes.
Attacks also targeted top Iranian military officials. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio quickly announced that the United States had not been involved.
Shortly afterwards, Iran began punitive strikes deep inside Israel, hitting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Iranian officials have said the mission will continue as long as necessary.
On Saturday, Israel carried out at least two strikes on Iranian energy infrastructure, ratcheting up the war to a new level. Another major wave of punitive Iranian strikes is expected on Saturday night.

Vladimir Putin told Donald Trump that Russia stands by proposals to resolve issues concerning Iran’s nuclear programme. (AFP pic)
MOSCOW
:
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to US President Donald Trump for 50 minutes yesterday, focusing on hostilities between Israel and Iran and calling for efforts to bring them to an end.
Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Putin condemned the Israeli military operation against Iran and expressed concern about the risks of escalation.
Trump, in his account on Truth Social, said most of the discussion centred on the Middle East, but that he also told Putin that Russia’s war in Ukraine should end.
“Vladimir Putin condemned Israel’s military operation against Iran and expressed serious concern about a possible escalation of the conflict, which would have unpredictable consequences for the entire situation in the Middle East,” Ushakov told reporters.
Ushakov said Trump described events in the Middle East as “very alarming”.
But the two leaders said they do not rule out a return to the negotiating track on Iran’s nuclear programme, Ushakov said.
Ushakov said US negotiators were ready to hold further talks with Iranian representatives, with Oman as mediator.
The latest round, scheduled for today in Oman, has been cancelled.
The Kremlin aide said Putin told Trump that Russia stood by proposals to ease tension and resolve issues concerning Iran’s nuclear programme.
“The Russian president recalled that prior to the current rise in tension our side had proposed concrete steps intended to find mutually acceptable agreements during talks between US and Iranian representatives about the Iranian nuclear programme,” Ushakov said.
“Russia’s principled approach and interest in a resolution is unchanged and, as Vladimir Putin noted, we will continue to act based on this.”
Trump’s account of the conversation included what amounted to his first explicit appeal for the hostilities to end.
“The call lasted approximately 1 hour,” Trump wrote.
“He feels, as do I, this war in Israel-Iran should end, to which I explained, his war should also end.”
Trump said he and Putin mostly discussed the Middle East and spent “much less time” talking about the war in Ukraine.
Trump hinted at follow-up discussions on the war in Ukraine in the coming week.
On Ukraine, Ushakov said Putin told the US leader that Russia was ready to continue negotiations with the Ukrainians after June 22, according to state news agency RIA.
Ushakov also said that the presidents expressed satisfaction “at their personal relations which have allowed for them to speak in a business-like manner to seek solutions to issues that are bilateral or on the international agenda, however complex those issues might be”.
Putin also congratulated Trump on his 79th birthday.

WASHINGTON, June 15 (Bernama-Anadolu) -- United States (US) President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for nearly an hour, with much of the conversation focused on tensions between Israel and Iran, Anadolu Ajansi (AA) reported.
  “President Putin called this morning to very nicely wish me a Happy Birthday, but more importantly, to talk about Iran, a country he knows very well,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.
  He said both leaders agreed that the conflict between Israel and Iran should end. “To which I explained, his war should also end,” Trump added, referring to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
  While the conversation largely focused on the Middle East, Trump noted that he and Putin would discuss the Russia-Ukraine war “next week”.
  "He is doing the planned prisoner swaps - large numbers of prisoners are being exchanged, immediately, from both sides," he added.

PARIS (Reuters) -French President Emmanuel Macron will visit Greenland on Sunday, in a show of solidarity with Denmark meant to send a signal of European resolve after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to take over the island.
  Greenland is a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark with the right to declare independence. Both the Greenland and Danish governments say it is not for sale and only Greenlanders can determine their future.
  President Donald Trump has said he wants the United States to take over the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island, and has not ruled out force. His vice president, JD Vance, visited a U.S. military base there in March.
  Macron, the first foreign leader to visit Greenland since Trump's explicit threats to "get" the island, was invited by the prime ministers of Greenland and Denmark. He has said his visit is meant to prevent any "preying" on the territory.
  "France has stood by us since the first statements about taking our land emerged. This support is both necessary and gratifying," Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen  wrote on Facebook days ahead of Macron's visit.
  Asked if Macron would deliver an explicit message to the United States during his visit, an adviser to Macron told reporters: "The trip is a signal in itself," without mentioning Trump.
  According to an IFOP poll for NYC.eu published on Saturday, 77% of the French and 56% of Americans disapprove of an annexation of Greenland by the U.S. And 43% of the French would approve using French military power to prevent a U.S. invasion.
  Macron will visit the capital Nuuk, as well as a hydropower station funded by the EU and a glacier, and discuss Arctic security and climate change with his hosts.
  Though Denmark is an EU member, Greenland is outside the bloc. The French adviser said the visit will be an opportunity to discuss how to give Greenland's association partnership with the EU a "new dimension".
  Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen made several visits to Paris after Trump's threats to seek French and European backing, and has placed orders for French-made surface-to-air missiles, in a shift of focus for Copenhagen.
  Enlisting the EU's only nuclear power is a way for Denmark, long one of Washington's most loyal allies in Europe, to project a form of hard power towards a suddenly more aggressive United States, Florian Vidal of the Paris-based IFRI think-tank said. 
  "The Trump administration's more aggressive posture is a shock that makes the French vision of Europe, one that is more autonomous, appear more reasonable for Denmark," he said. "From a Nordic point of view, France is a military power that counts."

COPENHAGEN, June 15 — Greenland, which President Donald Trump wants to annex for US national and international security needs, is an ice-covered self-governing Danish territory in the Arctic.
  Today, French President Emmanuel Macron will become the first foreign head of state to visit the strategically important 2.1 million square kilometre island, which holds vast untapped mineral resources, since Trump’s annexation threat.
  Closer to New York  
  Greenland, which has a population of about 57,000 people, is an autonomous territory but Copenhagen controls its law enforcement, monetary policy, foreign affairs, defence and security policy.
  However, with its capital closer to New York than Copenhagen, Greenland is in the United States’ “zone of interest”, historian Astrid Andersen, of the Danish Institute of International Studies, told AFP.
  During World War II, when Denmark was occupied by Germany “the US took over Greenland. In a sense they have never left,” she explained.
  The United States has one active military base there. The Pituffik space base was used during the Cold War as a warning post for possible Soviet attacks and is still an essential part of the US missile defence infrastructure.
  Greenland’s location puts it on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the United States.
  Washington has “legitimate complaints about the lack of surveillance of the airspace and submarine areas east of Greenland,” said Ulrik Pram Gad, also of the Danish Institute of International Studies.
  Also its strategic position for when new shipping lanes are freed up due to melting ice adds importance, but Pram Gad believes Trump is using “exaggerated terms”.
  Trump in 2019, during his first term in office, floated the idea of a US purchase of Greenland, but that was rebuffed.
  Potential mining sector  
  Since 2009, Greenlanders have been in charge of deciding how their natural resources are used.
  Access to Greenland’s resources is considered crucial by the United States, which signed a cooperation memorandum for the sector in 2019. The EU followed four years later with its own agreement.
  Greenland’s soil is well-explored, which has enabled a detailed map of resources to be drawn up.
  The EU has identified 25 of the 34 minerals on its official list of critical raw materials in Greenland, including rare earths.
  “As the demand for minerals is rising, there is a need to go and look for untapped resources,” said Ditte Brasso Sorensen, an analyst at Think Tank Europa.
  “Actors are more and more aware they need to diversify their sources, especially when it comes to the dependence to China on rare earth elements.”
  Adding to this is the fear that China will get its hands on the mineral resources, she explained.
  Yet mining in Greenland is currently largely non-existent.
  There are only two mines on the island — one for rubies, which is looking for new investors, and the other for anorthosite, a rock containing titanium.
  Financially dependent  
  Economically, the territory, which is seeking to move away from Danish rule, depends on annual subsidies from Copenhagen — which account for a fifth of its GDP — and on fishing.
  The population’s hopes are partly pinned on the opening of an international airport in the capital, Nuuk, in November to help develop tourism in the Arctic region.
  Infrastructure is also a key issue for the development of the mining industry.
  “When it comes to extractive industries, Trump is putting Greenland on the mining map in discourse but it’s hard to say how it could evolve as there is a lack of investors,” noted Lill Rastad Bjorst, an associate professor at Aalborg University specialising in Greenland.
  Sorensen also stressed the inherent difficulties of extracting resources in Greenland, with its “very harsh weather conditions, a protected environment and lots of costs with the need to develop the physical and digital infrastructure”.
  Public opposition to uranium mining in southern Greenland prompted legislation banning the extraction of radioactive products.
  Another potential resource to be exploited is oil but this is at a standstill.
  “The government of Greenland has paused their commitment to oil exploration in Greenland and sees a great potential in hydropower,” Rastad Bjorst said. — AFP

PARIS
:
French President Emmanuel Macron will travel to Greenland today carrying a message of “European solidarity and support” for the Danish autonomous territory coveted by US President Donald Trump, located at the crossroads of the Atlantic and the Arctic.
Macron will be the first foreign head of state to set foot on the vast territory – roughly nine times larger than the UK, with 80% of its area covered in ice – since Trump’s annexation threats.
Trump has repeatedly said the US needs the strategically located, resource-rich Arctic island for security reasons, and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it.
The deep sea, Greenland and Antarctica are “not for sale”, Macron said Monday at a UN oceans summit, remarks clearly directed at Trump’s expansionist claims.
“I’m going to say: ‘We’re here, and we’re ready to reinvest ourselves so that there is no preying'” on it, Macron said a few days ahead of his trip.
Following his arrival in Greenland’s capital Nuuk at 11.30am, the French leader will visit a glacier, a hydroelectric power plant and a Danish frigate.
He will be accompanied throughout his visit by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen.
Macron’s trip will be “a signal in itself made at the request of Danish and Greenlandic authorities”, his office said.
‘Not for sale’
The Danish invitation to Macron contrasts sharply with the reception granted to US vice-president JD Vance, whose one-day trip to Greenland in March was seen as a provocation by both Nuuk and Copenhagen.
During his visit to the US Pituffik military base, Vance castigated Denmark for not having “done a good job by the people of Greenland”, alleging they had neglected security.
The Pituffik base is an essential part of Washington’s missile defence infrastructure, its location putting it on the shortest route for missiles fired from Russia at the US.
Polls indicate that the vast majority of Greenland’s 57,000 inhabitants want to become independent from Denmark – but do not wish to become part of the US.
Denmark has also repeatedly stressed that Greenland “is not for sale”.
The Arctic has gained geostrategic importance as the race for rare earths heats up and as melting ice caused by global warming opens up new shipping routes.
As a result, Copenhagen in January announced a US$2 billion plan to boost its military presence in the Arctic region.
Nato also plans to set up a Combined Air Operations Centre (CAOC) in Norway above the Arctic Circle, as Russia aims to bolster its military presence in the region.
During his visit, Macron plans to discuss Arctic security and how to include the territory in “European action” to contribute to its development, while “respecting its sovereignty”, his office said.
Mount Nunatarsuaq
Macron will also see first-hand the effects of climate change when he visits a glacier on Mount Nunatarsuaq, about 30km from Nuuk.
Greenland’s ice sheet melted 17 times faster than the historical average during a May 15-21 heatwave in Greenland, a recent report showed.
France intends to “massively reinvest in the knowledge of these ecosystems”, following the footsteps of famed French explorer Paul-Emile Victor who carried out multiple expeditions to Greenland, Macron’s office said.
Greenlandic authorities recently designated Victor’s hut, built in 1950 in Quervain Bay in the north, as an historic structure.
At a hydroelectric power station in Buksefjorden, located 600m inside a mountain and funded by the European Union, the three leaders will discuss Greenland’s decarbonisation and energy supply.
Unlike Denmark, Greenland is not part of the European Union but is on the list of overseas territories associated with the bloc.

As Malaysia prepares for the rollout of the 2027 national curriculum, which will transition classroom instruction towards values-based and student-centred learning, a targeted training initiative is laying the foundation to help teachers lead this transformation.
  The approach focuses on practical strategies that foster emotional development, empathy, and stronger teacher-student relationships.
  AlinaFor the first time, 70 teachers from across the country have completed formal training in building emotional intelligence through the Program Guru Karisma (Karakter Inspirasi Masyarakat) – a year-long initiative designed and led by Arus Academy, with full funding from Yayasan Hasanah, a foundation under Khazanah Nasional, and the Finance Ministry.
  Held in conjunction with the Sidang Guru Kemuncak Karisma 2025 in Putrajaya on May 29, the culmination of the programme brought together 300 educators – including the 70 trained participants – for a one-day national summit that blended expert-led workshops, classroom showcases and panel discussions focused on holistic education.
  Teachers explored how to embed social and emotional learning (SEL) into academic subjects – an increasingly vital competency under the 2027 curriculum.
  Pang“The upcoming curriculum will shift the role of teachers beyond content delivery – it’s about nurturing emotionally grounded, values-driven young people,” said Arus Academy co-founder Alina Amir.
  Program Guru Karisma, she added, equips teachers with the tools and mindset to create meaningful learning environments that reflect this shift.
  “This is about elevating the teaching profession – preparing educators to meet the emotional and social needs of today’s learners with confidence and care,” she said in a press release.
  The summit featured a national showcase of over 125 classroom activities and 70 action research projects led by the Karisma cohort.
  These highlighted how SEL practices can boost student engagement, reduce classroom conflict and build stronger interpersonal connections in the learning environment.
  International SEL expert Keeth Matheny, founder of SEL Launchpad, also participated in the summit, leading sessions alongside interactive masterclasses on SEL-integrated pedagogy, teacher well-being and holistic student assessment.
  A multidisciplinary panel of experts from the education, corporate and civil society sectors also convened to discuss new models of student assessment that measure not just academic outcomes, but also empathy, collaboration and social responsibility.
  Yayasan Hasanah trustee and managing director Siti Kamariah Ahmad Subki said when teachers are equipped to lead with empathy and intention, they are not just transforming classrooms, but also shaping a more compassionate and resilient education system for Malaysia.
  “Through Program Guru Karisma, we’re investing in teachers as agents of change – a vital part of the wider ecosystem that supports our children’s growth.
  “Alongside families, communities, and the whole-of-nation effort, teachers will be equipped with the skills and confidence to nurture a generation of empathetic, socially conscious learners,” she said.
  The one-year training opened my eyes to the importance of exploring SEL– not just for students, but for us as teachers. SEL gave me tools to manage my own emotions better, which has helped me become a more balanced and effective educator.
  – SK Kiaramas, KL, teacher Sarinah Suratman
  Many students today struggle with focus, frustration and peer conflict. As teachers, we often lack the tools to address these issues beyond academics. The programme gave us practical ways to integrate SEL into daily lessons – helping students manage emotions, collaborate better, and build stronger relationships in the classroom.

KUALA LUMPUR: A new initiative that will see nearly 400,000 educators trained in artificial intelligence (AI) applications has been announced as part of a move to modernise Malaysia’s teaching force.
  Human Resources Minister Steven Sim said the programme, titled “AI for Educators”, will be implemented in collaboration with the Education Ministry.
  Involving 395,000 educators, the programme aims not only to equip teachers with technical AI skills but also to deepen their understanding of ethical considerations in using such technologies in the classroom.
  “Our teachers are the frontliners in human capital development. 
  “They must be empowered with the latest knowledge and tools to prepare our people for the challenges of the AI era.
  “This reflects not only the commitment of the Human Resources Ministry but also the wider commitment of the Madani government to ensuring our educators lead the way,” he said in his speech at the National Training Week (NTW) 2025 summit in Bukit Jalil here yesterday.
  Sim also revealed that this year’s NTW had surpassed all expectations with over two million Malaysians participating in the free training sessions, double the initial target of one million.
  “This is the third year we are organising the NTW and it has grown in scale and impact. 
  “Last year, we reached around 300,000 participants. This year, we’ve gone beyond our target even during the launch week,” he added. 
  According to Sim, over 71,000 free training sessions were offered across the country, with more than 40% of them focused on Industry 4.0-related skills, including digital tools, automation and emerging technologies.
  He also extended an invitation to citizens from across Asean, saying that this year’s NTW was open not just to Malaysians but also to participants from neighbouring countries, a move in line with Malaysia’s role as Asean Chair this year.
  “This is our commitment to building regional human capital and strengthening cooperation in a rapidly evolving economic landscape,” he said.

KUALA LUMPUR: Several programmes at institutions of higher learning (IPT) need to be reviewed to get them in line with recent technological developments, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), says Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir.
  The Higher Education Minister said the review is important considering there are faculties or departments that were established around two to three decades ago based on market needs at the time.
  “Yes, there will be courses that need to be reviewed because there are certain faculties or departments that were established around 20 to 30 years ago. At that time, the industry’s needs were different compared to now,” he said at the Higher Education Ministry’s (KPT) National Career Carnival here yesterday.
  Zambry said not all programmes need to be changed, citing, for example, computer science.
  “But its teaching approach is now different. We ask all universities to re-evaluate their programmes in the current context,” he said, reported Bernama.
  Although the employability rate of graduates in the country was 92%, Zambry said the government wants to reduce the numbers of those who are underemployed.
  “We are working to address the issue of underemployment. Programmes like today’s are held to open up more space and opportunities for graduates and jobseekers so that they can work in fields related to their qualifications and expertise,” he added.
  KPT secretary-general Datuk Dr Anesee Ibrahim said the large-scale career carnival is among the key activities in the Graduate Employability Strategic Plan (PSKG) 2021-2025, which is now entering the final phase of implementation.
  “The new PSKG 2026-2030 plan being developed is in line with the Malaysian Higher Education Plan (PPTM) 2025-2035, which is expected to be launched soon. Among the main focuses of the new plan are producing value-based graduates, enhancing academic performance and empowering higher education institutions to a global level,” he said.
  The two-day KPT National Career Carnival 2025, which started yesterday, brings together over 100 leading local companies from various key sectors, including investED, Bank Negara Malaysia, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, PayNet, Infineon Technologies, IJM Corporation Bhd, SD Guthrie Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.
  Earlier, Zambry witnessed the signing of two memorandums of understanding (MOU) between KPT and ACCA Malaysia as well as Malaysia Rail Link Sdn Bhd (MRL), aimed at strengthening cooperation between higher education institutions and professional bodies in the fields of accounting, finance and rail transportation.
  He also handed over a mock cheque for the implementation of the KPT’s Industrial and Professional Credentialing Programme (KPTiP), which was approved for three recipients: The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, ACCA Malaysia and MRL, with a total value of RM13,313,200.

The dawn of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has sparked both excitement and anxiety among educators.
  On one hand, many of us are rejoicing over the convenience of having AI assist with lesson planning, resource generation and assessment tasks – tasks that often consume valuable time.
  On the other hand, concerns emerge. Is that essay really written by the student? Are we outsourcing imagination and creativity to algorithms? What exactly are the rules when your co-teacher is a chatbot?
  As AI settles into the classroom, the real challenge is not whether we should use it, but how to do so without losing the human connection that makes teaching meaningful.
  Curriculum design is a long game, often taking years to develop, test and implement. Meanwhile, AI moves at breakneck speed, evolving in ways that can upend teaching practices within months. To bridge this gap, we need more than just new education standards or syllabi – we need a dynamic and responsive framework that evolves continuously.
  This means embracing flexible curriculum structures, integrating AI in teacher education, establishing collaborative learning ecosystems, and most importantly, supporting our teachers every step of the way.
  Reimagining teaching 
  One way to ensure that AI becomes an integral part of the curriculum without being a fleeting trend is the idea of a “living curriculum” – one that is regularly reviewed and iteratively updated.
  If we want AI tools to serve education meaningfully, we need structures that allow for fast yet thoughtful integration.
  Still, updating the curriculum alone isn’t enough.
  The success of AI in education also hinges on how it is enacted in the classroom. By embedding AI literacy into teacher education, we move beyond simply producing more tech-savvy teachers to cultivating stronger teaching practices.
  After all, even a less-than-exceptional teacher might occasionally deliver a good lesson with the right tools and support. But sustainable, high-quality teaching demands thoughtful integration of AI into pedagogy – not just excitement over shiny new tools.
  To support both effective teaching and meaningful curriculum development, schools and universities must embrace the idea of collaborative learning ecosystems.
  By partnering with tech companies, research institutions and AI developers, educational institutions can access cutting-edge tools, insights and expertise. These collaborations can lead to pilot programmes, shared innovations and real-time feedback loops to ensure that the curriculum evolves with AI advancements.
  That said, we also need to be cautious. Not every AI tool adds value. Teachers should always ask themselves: Does this genuinely enhance student learning, or are we just using tech for tech’s sake?
  Upskilling together 
  Let’s be honest – this rapid AI evolution can feel overwhelming.
  As institutions look outward for innovation, they must also look inward to support the people driving change – the teachers.
  We need to make upskilling accessible and ongoing. We need professional learning that builds confidence, not just competence.
  We also need each other. Sustained support through peer networks, mentorship and collaborative spaces where we can reflect, share and troubleshoot together is essential. No teacher should be expected to figure this out alone. Yes, systemic reform takes time but that does not mean we cannot act now.
  I believe we can build an education system that is agile, inclusive and future-focused. It starts with us: educators who are ready to engage, institutions that are ready to evolve, and innovations driven by real purpose – not just the latest hype.
  Teachers must be prepared to stimulate, provoke and challenge thinking. In doing so, we can ensure our students grow up not as passive consumers of AI, but as curious, capable co-creators of the world they will inherit.

As of May, more than 400,000 Malaysians have received AI training under the initiative under Microsoft’s AI for Malaysia’s Future (AIForMYFuture) initiative, according to the tech giant. (AFP pic)
PETALING JAYA
:
Microsoft has reaffirmed its commitment to a RM10.5 billion investment in cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in Malaysia, including the development of hyperscale data centres in the Klang Valley.
A spokesperson for Microsoft Malaysia told FMT the tech giant is closely monitoring the ongoing uncertainty following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs in April, which unsettled stock and currency markets before a 90-day pause was declared a week later.
“Microsoft remains committed to our investment in Malaysia to accelerate the nation’s AI and cloud adoption. As a company, the tariff is something we are watching, but we don’t have anything to share right now,” it said.
Citing people familiar with the situation, Bloomberg reported in April that Microsoft had either halted talks for, or delayed the development of, data centre projects in Indonesia, the UK and Australia, as well as Illinois, North Dakota and Wisconsin in the US.
Microsoft acknowledged making changes to its data centre plans at the time, saying the move reflected the flexibility of the company’s strategy and aligned with its goal of ensuring it has “sufficient infrastructure in the right places”.
Last month, Microsoft announced the general availability of the Malaysia West cloud region in Greater Kuala Lumpur comprising three availability zones aimed at offering low-latency connections and a highly resilient infrastructure, including Azure and Microsoft 365.
Additionally, Microsoft Malaysia managing director Laurence Si previously said the company is also investing in talent development through its “AI for Malaysia’s Future” (AIForMYFuture) initiative, which aims to equip 800,000 Malaysians with AI skills by the end of 2025.
In an interview with FMT, Microsoft Malaysia’s legal and government affairs director Adilah Junid revealed that, as of May, more than 400,000 Malaysians have received AI training under the initiative.
She also encouraged participation in the free AIForMYFuture initiative via Microsoft’s AI Skills Navigator website, and the monthly Microsoft AI Teach programmes held nationwide at local educational institutions and National Information Dissemination Centres.
“Microsoft relies heavily on local partners such as Biji-Biji, HRD Corp, Perkeso, Pepper Labs, and the International Women’s Federation of Commerce and Industry Malaysia.
“They are really the ones to have networks within the community and society, enabling us to make this opportunity as widely accessible as possible,” said Adilah.
Addressing concerns about sustainability, particularly the high water usage of data centres for cooling, she said Microsoft is constantly exploring innovative solutions to operate more sustainably.
“We were part of the consultations with the digital ministry’s guidelines for sustainable data centres.  We also work with authorities to ensure that our water and energy usage metrics are aligned,” said Adilah.

(Reuters) -Italy are set to appoint their former midfielder Gennaro Gattuso as new manager to replace the recently sacked Luciano Spalletti, Gianluigi Buffon, head of delegation with the Italian football federation (FIGC), said on Saturday.
  "We have worked, we are now waiting for the final details," Buffon, speaking at the Under-21 European Championship, told Italy's state broadcaster RAI when asked to confirm that Gattuso would be announced as the new coach.
  "The president and the whole federation have had some busy days but I think that in the end we made the best choice."
  Spalletti's sacking came after less than two years in the job, taking charge for the final time in the 2-0 win over Moldova the day after he announced his own dismissal following a 3-0 loss in Norway in Italy's opening World Cup qualifying game.
  Gattuso, who made 73 appearances for Italy and was a member of the 2006 World Cup winning squad, recently left Croatian club Hajduk Split by mutual consent, after a third-placed finish in the country's top flight.
  (Reporting by Trevor Stynes)
  
------------------------------
ROM: Pengurus pasukan Itali, Gianluigi Buffon, mengesahkan bahawa mereka akan melantik Gennaro Gattuso sebagai jurulatih baharu bagi menggantikan Luciano Spalletti yang dipecat.
  Skuad Azzurri tidak mempunyai jurulatih selepas Spalletti dipecat susulan kekalahan 3-0 kepada Norway, walaupun dia masih berada di bangku simpanan semasa kemenangan 2-0 ke atas Norway.
  “Kami telah membuat keputusan terbaik yang mungkin. Kami sedang mengusahakannya, sekarang hanya menunggu butiran akhir.
  “Presiden dan persekutuan telah melalui hari-hari yang sibuk dengan pelbagai perkara. Saya rasa pada akhirnya kami telah membuat keputusan terbaik,” kata Buffon kepada RAI Sport.
  Pilihan utama sebenarnya adalah Claudio Ranieri, tetapi dia telah pun membuat komitmen untuk menjadi penasihat khas Roma dan mengumumkan persaraannya daripada kejurulatihan.
  Walaupun terdapat calon lain seperti Stefano Pioli, Daniele De Rossi dan Fabio Cannavaro, ternyata Gattuso menjadi pilihan utama.
  Terdapat pertemuan dengan Buffon dan kemudian bersama Presiden Persatuan Bolasepak Itali (FIGC), Gabriele Gravina untuk menyusun butiran kontrak.
  “Kami sedang mencabar diri kami sendiri terlebih dahulu, tetapi perkara paling penting ialah kami perlu mengelakkan persembahan memalukan yang tidak wajar bagi Itali.
  “Terdapat pelbagai cara untuk kalah, dan saya rasa kita boleh mengelakkan cara yang paling buruk dengan sedikit penyesuaian,” kata Buffon yang merupakan ketua delegasi FIGC.

ROME
:
Italy are set to appoint their former midfielder Gennaro Gattuso as manager to replace the sacked Luciano Spalletti, Gianluigi Buffon, head of delegation with the Italian football federation (FIGC), said yesterday.
“We have worked, we are now waiting for the final details,” Buffon, speaking at the Under-21 European Championship, told Italy’s state broadcaster RAI when asked to confirm that Gattuso would be the new coach.
“The president and the whole federation have had some busy days but I think that in the end we made the best choice.”
Spalletti’s sacking came after less than two years in the job, taking charge for the final time in the 2-0 win over Moldova the day after he announced his own dismissal following a 3-0 loss in Norway in Italy’s opening World Cup qualifying game.
Gattuso, who made 73 appearances for Italy and was a member of the 2006 World Cup-winning squad, recently left Croatian club Hajduk Split by mutual consent, after a third-placed finish in the country’s top flight.
Claudio Ranieri had been the FIGC’s first choice, but the 73-year-old turned down the offer to focus on his senior adviser role at AS Roma.
Gattuso began his managerial career as player-coach at Swiss club Sion in 2013 where he finished his playing days after 13 seasons with AC Milan but was fired after winning two of his 10 league games in charge.
His only trophy as manager came at Napoli, lifting the Coppa Italia in 2020, in a 12-year career in which he has taken charge at nine clubs, including AC Milan, Valencia and a five-month spell at Olympique de Marseille.
Gattuso was appointed as Fiorentina manager in 2021, but 22 days later the club announced they had mutually rescinded the agreement, with reports citing disagreements over transfer strategy.
The 47-year-old will be tasked with getting Italy to next year’s World Cup, after they missed out on the last two tournaments, and will begin on the back foot after the humbling loss in Oslo.

SAN JOSE
:
Violeta Chamorro, who brought peace to Nicaragua after years of war and was the first woman elected president in the Americas, died today at the age of 95, her family said.
Chamorro, who ruled the poor Central American country from 1990 to 1997, “died in peace, surrounded by the affection and love of her children”, said a statement issued by her four children.
As president, Chamorro managed to bring to an end a civil war that had raged for much of the 1980s as US-backed rebels known as the ‘Contras’ fought the leftist Sandinista government.
That conflict made Nicaragua one of the big proxy battlegrounds of the Cold War.
Chamorro put her country on the path to democracy in the difficult years following the Sandinista revolution of 1979, which had toppled the US-backed right-wing regime of Anastasio Somoza.
In a country known for macho culture, Chamorro had a maternal style and was known for her patience and a desire for reconciliation.
When she won the 1990 election at the head of a broad coalition, she defeated Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista guerrilla leader and icon who is now president again.
Ortega has been in power for 17 years and is widely criticised by governments and rights groups as having crushed personal freedoms, all political opposition and judicial independence with autocratic rule.
Chamorro “represented a contribution for the peace necessary in our country”, Ortega and his wife Rosario Murillo, who has the title of co-president, said in a statement.
The former leader died in Costa Rica, where she moved in 2023, to be close to her children, three of whom are living here in exile because of their opposition to Ortega.
Chamorro – Nicaraguans referred to her affectionately as “Dona Violeta” – had been living far removed from public life for decades.
In her later years, she suffered from Alzheimer’s disease.
“Her legacy is unquestionable,” said Felix Madariaga, a Nicaraguan academic and political activist living in exile in the US.
“She led the transition from war to peace, healing a country destroyed by war. The contrast with Ortega is clear and deep,” said Madariaga.
‘Typical of a homemaker’
Chamorro was the widow of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, who came from one of Nicaragua’s most prominent families.
As owner and chief editor of the newspaper La Prensa, he was killed in 1978 in an attack blamed on the regime of Anastasio Somoza.
His death propelled Chamorro to take over the newspaper and, eventually, to get into politics.
After the Sandinistas seized power in 1979, she became the only female member of a national reconstruction government.
But she quit that junta in 1980, believing the Sandinistas were moving too far to the left and into the sphere of communist Cuba.
Chamorro became prominent in the opposition to the Sandinistas as they fought the ‘Contra’ rebels financed by the US under Ronald Reagan.
In 1990, she stunned the country by winning the presidency – and beating Ortega – as leader of a coalition of 14 parties.
During the campaign, she was known for wearing white and had to use a wheelchair because of a knee injury.
In her memoirs, Chamorro said she won because she gained the trust of war-weary Nicaraguans as she spoke in simple language “typical of a homemaker and a mother”.
“In the macho culture of my country, few people believed that I, a woman, and what is more, handicapped, had the strength, energy and will” to beat Ortega, she wrote.
“But if the Berlin Wall fell, why not the Sandinistas?”

Attacks in the central belt of Nigeria are often motivated by religious or ethnic differences. (EPA Images pic)
JOS
:
An overnight attack in a central Nigerian town killed at least 45 people, a spokesman for the state governor’s office told AFP today.
“Not fewer than 45 people have been confirmed killed by armed bandits in an early morning attack on Yelwata yesterday,” a town in Benue state, said spokesman Tersoo Kula.
Locals told AFP they feared around 100 people had died.
“It is terribly bad, many people have died,” Amineh Liapha Hir, a resident of the town, told AFP.
“It could be more than 100, and many houses were also burnt.”
Another local resident, Christian Msuega, said that he had escaped the attack but that his sister and brother-in-law had died, burned alive.
He, too, said he thought about 100 people had died, and blamed Fulani herdsmen for the attack.
Muslim ethnic Fulani nomadic herders have long clashed with settled farmers, many of whom are Christian, over access to land and resources.
Police spokesman Udeme Edet confirmed the attack to AFP, and said police had engaged the attackers in a gun battle.
The governor’s spokesman said: “There was a confirmed attack on the Yelwata community, which occurred around 10pm and lasted for about two hours, there were casualties and a number of houses burnt down.”
Kula said that government officials and the police commissioner had visited Yelwata “and have confirmed 45 peoples’ deaths”.
Attacks in this region, part of what is known as the central belt of Nigeria, are often motivated by religious or ethnic differences.
Two weeks ago, gunmen killed 25 people in two attacks Benue state.
------------------------------
(Reuters) -At least 100 people have been killed in an attack by gunmen on a village in Nigeria's central Benue state, Amnesty International Nigeria said Saturday.
  The attack took place from late Friday into the early hours of Saturday in the village of Yelewata, the group said in a post on social media platform X.
  "Many people are still missing...dozens injured and left without adequate medical care. Many families were locked up and burnt inside their bedrooms," the post added.
  Benue is in Nigeria's Middle Belt, a region where the majority Muslim North meets the largely Christian South. 
  The region faces competition over land use, with conflicts between herders, who seek grazing land for their cattle, and farmers, who need arable land for cultivation. These tensions are often worsened by overlapping ethnic and religious divisions.
  Last month, at least 42 people were shot dead by suspected herders in a series of weekend attacks across Gwer West district in Nigeria's central Benue state.
  Since 2019, the clashes have claimed more than 500 lives in the region and forced 2.2 million to leave their homes, according to research firm SBM Intelligence.

（贝努埃15日综合电）
尼日利亚
贝努埃州发生枪击，人权组织披露，当地耶勒瓦塔村庄周五（13日）深夜遭到
武装分子
袭击，造成至少100人死亡和数百人受伤， 当中许多伤者未获得妥善医疗照护，另有数十人失踪。
综合路透社和美联社外媒报道，国际特赦组织尼日利亚分部说明，这起袭击发生在13日当晚至14日凌晨，“许多家庭被锁在卧室里烧死，遗体烧得难以辨识。”
ADVERTISEMENT
社媒上流传草地遍布尸体与房屋被烧毁的画面，警方也证实这起事件，只是没透露死伤人数。
州长阿利亚已派遣代表团前往耶勒瓦塔，慰问受害人家属。
贝努埃州位于尼日利亚中部，作为穆斯林为主的北方与基督徒为主的南方交界，长年存在牧民与农民之间的土地与水源冲突。牧民多是富拉尼族（Fulani），主张土地为法定放牧区；农民控诉牲畜破坏作物，双方争端屡次引发致命事件。
邻近的高原州今年4月至少40人遇害，贝努埃州格韦西上月也发生疑似牧民的枪民杀害42人事件。自2019年以来，冲突已导致那里的500多人丧生，迫使220万人逃离家园。

纳尔斯的收藏超过1000枚，当中不乏极为稀有的古币。（照片取自Beaussant Lefèvre and Associates拍卖行）

后总价超过300万欧元（1466.85万令吉），远远超过原先估价。
《美国有线电视新闻网》（CNN）报道，这批金币的主人是保罗纳尔斯，生前住在法国西南部的一个小村庄。他过着极为简朴的生活，虽然不曾周游列国，可是却把毕生积蓄全都投入在收藏金币上。

根据拍卖行“Beaussant Lefèvre and Associates”表示，纳尔斯的收藏超过1000枚，当中不乏极为稀有的古币，例如来自西元前336至323年马其顿王国的金币，以及几乎完整的法国路易十四、路易十五与路易十六时期的金币系列。
由于纳尔斯没有子嗣，且很少人知道他有这项嗜好，更没人知道他将这批珍宝藏在哪里。直到他过世后，一名公证人受托处理他的遗产，才意外揭开了这个秘密。
这名公证人在一间储藏室的墙壁后、画作的背后，发现了一个隐密空间，里面藏有这批金币。不只如此，还有10包额外的金币，每包都有172枚20法郎面额的金币，相当于金条等级的价值。
原先估价为200万欧元（977.90万令吉），最终拍卖金额却高达300多万欧元，成为近期拍卖市场上最引人注目的宝藏故事之一。

近来我国出现异常酷热的高温天气，主要是受到西南季候风的影响，大马气象局总监莫哈末希山甚至预测这种极端高温现象可能将持续至9月。热浪来袭可能威胁到人体健康与公共安全，因此民众有必要提高警惕，并积极采取应对措施，同时也避免进行任何可能会加剧气候恶化的行为。
ADVERTISEMENT
高温对人体健康的威胁不容忽视，尤其长时间暴露在炎热环境下更容易引发中暑、脱水等症状，家中有儿童、长者及慢性病患者更要特别留意。若无必要，民众应尽量减少外出，若要外出请务必做好防护措施，如穿比较透气的衣物，使用伞具或帽子，并随时补充水分。在炎热天气，也应该避免进行激烈的户外运动，减少体力的大量消耗。
在饮食方面，不妨多摄取含水量高的蔬果，适时补充体内水分，同时减少油腻、辛辣食物的摄取，保持清淡饮食。如果发现身边的人出现中暑迹象如体温升高、恶心呕吐等，应尽速带他们前往求医。
此外，乾燥高温亦大大增加火灾风险，露天焚烧更对环境与空气品质造成严重影响。民众必须严格遵守当局颁布的指示行事，停止一切露天焚烧活动，以免导致火势失控，危害社区安全。露天焚烧亦导致空气污染指数上升，对患有气喘或呼吸道疾病者尤为危险，在这气候异常时期，大家更应齐心保护环境与空气的品质。
面对气候变迁带来的严峻挑战，政府也采取了各项应对措施，包括持续推动节能减碳、环保政策与可再生能源的发展，民众也应发挥公民责任，从生活各方面的细节著手，例如减少使用一次性塑胶、落实资源分类与回收、使用节能家电、减少碳足迹等。唯有全民共同参与，方能有效缓解气候变迁带来的压力，打造永续的生活环境。
面对持续升高的气温，人民要照顾好自己的健康，减少患病的风险，政府在有需要时或可布云造雨，将高温为人民带来的影响程度降至最低。

KUALA LUMPUR : Menepis tanggapan negatif segelintir warganet,pengasas Finura, Nurulain Md Yusof, yakin tindakan penyanyi dan bekas anggota kumpulan Dolla,Syasya, berimej muslimah kini adalah kerana keikhlasannya sendiri. 
  Sehubungan itu, kata Nurulain, ia juga menidakkan dakwaan segelintir pihak bahawa penyanyi tersebut menggenakan hijab kini kononnya kerana ingin diambil sebagai duta syarikat tudung sepertinya. 
  “Syasya hijrah secara ikhlas tanpa paksaan mana-mana pihak. Disebabkan itu Finura juga memilih Syasya sebagai duta mereka. 
  “Harapan saya bukan sahaja untuk Finura malah buat Syasya, saya mahu peminat melihat perubahan hijrah Syasya sebagai satu perkara positif bukan disebabkan dia berhijab dapat jadi duta.
  “Saya harap kehadiran dia dalam keluarga Finura dapat meningkatkan keyakinan Syasya dalam bertudung,”katanya. 
  Terdahulu, Finura, jenama fesyen tudung yang semakin dikenali mengumumkan pelantikan penyanyi Syasya Rizal yang juga bekas ahli kumpulan Dolla sebagai duta rasmi mereka.
  Pelantikan ini menandakan kerjasama strategik antara Syasya dan Finura dalam menampilkan rekaan tudung moden, selesa dan eksklusif untuk wanita muslimah masa kini.
  Dalam pada itu, kata Nurulain, pemilihan Syasya sebagai duta adalah sangat tepat dalam memacu jenama Finura untuk lebih barjaya di masa hadapan.
  “Syarikat memang sedang mencari seorang duta, jadi satu hari saya terlihat video Syasya di TikTok yang mengenakan tudung bawal dan saya terus rasa dia sangat sesuai untuk menjadi duta Finura.
  “Jadi daripada situ saya rasa pemilihan Syasya sebagai duta adalah keputusan yang tepat dalam memberi impak positif buat Finura,” katanya.
  Berkongsi lanjut, Nurulain memberitahu Finura sudah ada rancangan bersama Syasya selama satu tahun kontrak mereka berjalan.
  Malah Finura memberikan kebebasan buat Syasya untuk menghasilkan sendiri rekaan serta warna tudung yang dimahukan sepanjang menjadi duta.
  “Dalam satu tahun, Finura sememangnya sudah merancang untuk mengeluarkan dua koleksi baharu setiap bulan.
  “Koleksi-koleksi itu kami beri kebebasan buat Syasya untuk pilih seperti warna dan corak yang dia inginkan.
  “Kami berikan dia kebebasan supaya dia bebas meneroka keselesaan dalam memakai tudung dan buatkan perjalanan hijrahnya semakin baik,” ujarnya.
  Dalam pada itu, Nurulain berharap kerjasama yang dilaksanakan ini memberi impak positif buat kedua-dua belah pihak.
  Koleksi pertama kolaborasi Finura bersama Syasya diberi nama The First Bloom akan dilancarkan menerusi sesi siaran langsung di TikTok jenama itu pukul 9 malam pada 17 Jun ini.
  Konsep tersebut diinspirasikan daripada perjalanan hijrah Syasya yang menggambarkan kekuatan dalam kelembutan serta keindahan seorang wanita yang sedang melangkah ke fasa baru dalam hidup.

  Terdahulu, satu majlis tahlil diadakan sebelum mesyuarat berkenaan bagi memperingati pemergian Allahyarham, malam tadi.
  Mengulas lanjut, Mohd. Zaidi memberitahu, beliau dimaklumkan bahawa punca kematian Norazamuddin adalah disebabkan oleh serangan jantung.
  “Saya difahamkan bahawa arwah memang ada masalah jantung dan jika tidak silap saya, arwah pernah menjalani pembedahan khas iaitu untuk memasang ‘stent’ pada jantung beberapa tahun yang lalu.
  “Mungkin keadaan cuaca di sana (Mekah) terlalu panas sehingga mungkin menyebabkan ramai jemaah yang keletihan termasuk arwah,” katanya yang menjelaskan, Allahyarham sepatutnya pulang ke tanah air bersama isterinya pada 2 Julai depan.
  Tambah Mohd. Zaidi, jenazah Norazamuddin bagaimanapun telah selamat disemadikan di Mekah selepas solat Subuh pagi tadi dan ketika ini, pihaknya sedang berusaha untuk membawa pulang isteri Allahyarham ke tanah air lebih awal.-UTUSAN

KLANG: Selangor Umno is making efforts to strengthen ties with its grassroots members to fortify the party's position in the state.
  The state chapter's youth chief Datuk Mohd Imran Tamrin said the usual practice was for the main leadership to liaise only with top division chiefs rather than directly with grassroots members.
  “We want to change that. That is why we recently gathered members from our 22 divisions to talk with them and inform them of Selangor Umno’s stand and objectives for them to understand our plans and vision,” said Mohd Imran.
  He referred to a massive gathering attended by almost 1,500 grassroots members earlier this week.
  Mohd Imran said the purpose of the gathering was also to show that Umno, as a party, not only has its ‘soldiers’ but also a large number of supporters
  He added that this adds value to the party and the unity government at the state and federal levels.
  “We want to show our visibility. The number of seats we hold in the state may just be two but Umno is not about the leaders, it is about the party’s grassroots supporters,” he said.
  Selangor Umno’s two state seats are currently Sungai Air Tawar (Datuk Rizam Ismail) and Dusun Tua (Datuk Johan Abd Aziz).
  Mohd Imran also said Selangor Umno is strengthening solidarity among state party leaders and enhancing grassroots support for the party.
  “We want to have a strong position in the state, regain the people’s trust, and reclaim Malay support in Selangor.
  "That is also why, as the party’s youth chief, I want our youth members to return to the basics and engage with the grassroots members,” he added.
  Mohd Imran said it is crucial for Umno Selangor to convey to grassroots members that the party will always defend Islam, Malay rights, and the sovereignty of the Malay rulers.

LUMUT: Malaysia is committed to defend the rights of oppressed nations, including Iran, says Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
  The Prime Minister lamented the silence of other wealthy Islamic countries.
  "Islamic countries are rich but they are not strong. When it comes to defending Iran, not many dare to speak up.
  "That is why I told my Cabinet colleagues that Malaysia must be capable.
  "We are an independent sovereign nation and we must defend the rights of Iran," he said in his speech at the closing of the Madani Rakyat programme held at the Lumut Waterfront here on Sunday (June 15).
  Anwar also criticised the hypocrisy of international powers over the recent Israeli strikes on Iran, which killed several scientists and military personnel.
  "When Iran retaliates to defend its dignity, European nations are quick to condemn.
  "Where were those voices when Israel launched its initial attack?" he asked.
  Anwar also praised Iran's resilience in the face of the long-standing economic sanctions, noting that the country had succeeded in developing its own capabilities in education, technology and defence without the support of major international corporations.
  He said that Malaysia, under the Madani government, would remain principled and defend justice on the international stage.
  Anwar said if Muslim countries remained divided, they would only become weaker.
  "This is why Gaza continues to be humiliated, occupied and bombed. Cities are reduced to rubble but the world remains silent," he said.

Woo Kah Leong bidas himpunan ‘Turun Anwar’ yang diumumkan Ketua Pemuda PAS Afnan Hamimi Taib Azamudden.
PETALING JAYA
:
Pemuda Pakatan Harapan (PH) mendakwa PAS cuba menonjolkan dominasi dalam Perikatan Nasional (PN) apabila sayapnya menggerakkan himpunan ‘Turun Anwar’ yang sebelum ini berkait Akta Pembaharuan Semula Bandar (URA), bulan depan.
Ketuanya Woo Kah Leong berkata perhimpunan dijadualkan pada 27 Jul depan itu disifatkan sebagai helah dan sandiwara politik PAS yang kini menguasai jawatan menteri besar di Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu dan Perlis.
Menurutnya, jumlah kerusi Parlimen PAS juga lebih tinggi berbanding rakannya, Bersatu.
“Oleh itu, himpunan itu hanyalah sandiwara politik untuk memperkukuhkan kedudukan PAS dalam PN di samping mengekang pengaruh Bersatu.
“Hakikatnya, PN kini berpecah-belah, tidak mempunyai dasar pentadbiran menyeluruh, tidak kiranya di peringkat persekutuan mahupun dalam empat negeri yang ditadbir tidak mampu membuat keputusan calon perdana menteri,” katanya dalam kenyataan.
“Daripada melaungkan slogan ‘Turun Anwar’, lebih baik PN mengadakan mesyuarat dalaman untuk membuat keputusan tentang calon perdana menteri mereka.”
Semalam, Ketua Pemuda PAS Afnan Hamimi Taib Azamudden mengumumkan himpunan membantah URA ditukar kepada ‘Himpunan Turun Anwar’, antaranya bagi menyatakan solidariti kepada Yusoff Rawther.
Katanya, keputusan itu berikutan permohonan Perdana Menteri Anwar Ibrahim untuk merujuk kepada mahkamah persoalan undang-undang termasuk sama ada perdana menteri mempunyai imuniti daripada saman, berkaitan saman sivil yang difailkan oleh Yusoff.
Himpunan Bantah Ura pada mulanya dijadualkan pada 14 Jun, namun Pemuda PAS mengambil keputusan untuk menangguhkannya susulan penangguhan sidang Dewan Rakyat pada 21 Julai hingga 28 Ogos depan.
Woo turut menyifatkan perubahan itu membuktikan PAS tidak mempunyai hala tuju berkait dasar awam dan hanya tahu menunggang isu.
“Sebelum ini Pemuda PAS beria-ria membantah PSB (URA) biarpun akta itu belum pun dibentang atau dibahas dalam Parlimen, namun kini bertukar wajah dan fokus menyerang PMX (Anwar),” katanya.

PETALING JAYA
:
Pakatan Harapan Youth has mocked PAS Youth for turning a planned protest against the Urban Renewal Act (URA) into one calling for the prime minister’s resignation.
PH Youth chief Woo Kah Leong said such a protest was “laughable” when Perikatan Nasional (PN) cannot even agree on who’s their own candidate for the top job.
He added that the Islamic party and its coalition partners, Bersatu and Gerakan, remain divided on who should succeed Anwar, should PN win the next general election (GE16).
“Has PN officially decided on whether (PAS president) Abdul Hadi Awang, (Bersatu president) Muhyiddin Yassin, or (Bersatu deputy president) Hamzah Zainudin is their pick for prime minister?” he asked in a statement today.
Woo claimed the rebranded July 27 rally – initially announced as a protest against the URA – is nothing more than political theatre by PAS to demonstrate its dominance within PN while keeping Bersatu in check.
“In reality, PN is fragmented and lacks comprehensive administrative policies, be it at the federal level or in the four states it governs,” he said, referring to Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah and Perlis, where all the menteris besar are from PAS.
“It can’t even decide on a prime minister candidate. Instead of chanting ‘Turun Anwar’, PN should focus on having an internal meeting to make that decision.”
PAS Youth first announced the rally in February, warning that the proposed URA could lead to the displacement of certain communities. The bill is expected to be tabled in the Dewan Rakyat next month.
However, PAS Youth chief Afnan Hamimi Taib Azamudden yesterday announced that the wing decided to “rebrand” the rally to one demanding that Anwar step down, called “Turun Anwar”.
The issue of PN’s prime ministerial candidate is still subject to ongoing discussions within the coalition.
PAS has not officially acknowledged Muhyiddin as the candidate, suggesting that it might prefer one of its leaders, as the party is the largest bloc in PN with 43 parliamentary seats.
However, Bersatu vice-president Ahmad Faizal Azumu was reported to have said Muhyiddin remains PN’s sole candidate for the prime minister’s position at GE16.

JOHOR BAHRU, June 15 (Bernama) -- A total of 2,197 UMNO branches across Johor have successfully conducted their meetings, reflecting the continued strength and loyalty of the party’s grassroots, said state UMNO chairman Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi.
  He said the meetings mark a turning point in reinvigorating the party’s operations and its spirit of struggle.
  “This is not just a number; it is clear proof that Johor UMNO’s grassroots remain strong and unwavering. In this birthplace of UMNO, the pulse of our struggle has never faltered,” he said in a statement today.
  The Johor Menteri Besar called on all members to use the branch meetings as a launching pad for unity, strategic planning and restoring public confidence in UMNO as the guardian of their future.
  He said the meetings are not merely organisational matters, but an important platform to strengthen the party’s machinery and promote the narrative of Johor’s achievements under UMNO leadership.
  “The Maju Johor agenda is not just an administrative policy, it is a reflection of Johor UMNO’s values and struggle. It must be understood, widely disseminated and championed down to the grassroots,” he said.
  UMNO division delegates meetings will be held from June 9 to July 27.

PERMATANG PAUH : Ahli UMNO khususnya dinasihatkan untuk menjaga imej parti itu agar ia sentiasa kelihatan baik pada pandangan mata rakyat.
  Ahli Majlis Kerja Tertinggi UMNO, Datuk Seri Dr. Shamsul Anuar Nasarah berkata, hal ini demikian kerana, rakyat terutamanya generasi muda inginkan sebuah parti yang benar-benar dilihat baik serta mampu memberikan tawaran terbaik untuk masa depan mereka.
  “Ini yang perlu kita lakukan (menjaga imej parti). Justeru, kesempatan yang ada ini (mesyuarat perwakilan) harus digunakan oleh pimpinan UMNO bahagian dengan sebaiknya untuk mendapat pandangan-pandangan ‘akar umbi’ mengenai bagaimana caranya UMNO boleh terus menjadi parti yang terbaik.
  “Saya percaya, jika imej kita baik, kita akan dapat sokongan daripada orang muda dan orang Melayu itu sendiri. Ini seterusnya boleh membantu UMNO untuk kembali menjadi parti dominan dalam negara selepas ini,” katanya.
  Beliau ditemui pemberita selepas merasmikan Mesyuarat Perwakilan Wanita, Pemuda dan Puteri UMNO Permatang Pauh yang turut dihadiri oleh Ketua UMNO Bahagian Permatang Pauh, Datuk Mohd. Zaidi Mohd. Said di sebuah hotel di sini, hari ini.
  Terdahulu, satu majlis tahlil diadakan sebelum mesyuarat bermula bagi memperingati pemergian Naib Ketua UMNO Bahagian Permatang Pauh, Norazamuddin Ahmad, 56, yang meninggal dunia di Mekah, malam tadi.
  Mengulas lanjut, Shamsul Anuar berkata, adalah penting untuk UMNO kembali menjadi parti dominan di negara ini seperti yang dinyatakan oleh Presiden parti, Datuk Seri Dr. Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, semalam.
  Dalam hal ini katanya, dominan yang dimaksudkan bukan hanya menjadi parti dominan dalam menentukan hala tuju politik negara, malah, harus dominan dalam mendapatkan sokongan majoriti orang Melayu.
  Beliau berkata, ini sangat penting kerana UMNO kebiasaannya akan bertanding di kawasan yang majoritinya dihuni oleh pengundi Melayu.
  “Pada masa yang sama, kita (UMNO) juga akan terus kekal menjadi parti yang menjaga kepentingan kaum-kaum lain dalam negara ini.
  “Maknanya, kita mesti mendapatkan sokongan orang Melayu tanpa kita ketepikan sokongan daripada kaum-kaum lain,” ujar Shamsul Anuar.-UTUSAN

他说，若沙盟确实有意与国阵在民主战场公平竞争，巫统沙巴乐于迎战，并视之为一次检验政党实力与人民信任的良机。
“在民主制度中，竞争不是威胁，而是验证政党是否真正获得人民信任的途径，而非靠短期妥协或借来的支持。”
然而，他也强调，
沙巴国阵
及巫统不会被其他政党牵动步伐，也不会为了凑数字而勉强合作。
“我们不需任何人开绿灯才行动。更重要的是，我们的决策是基于政治合法性、策略自主以及诚信合作的整体考量。”
“我们不排斥合作，但合作必须建立在真诚的基础上，而非仅为了凑数字或强化一个缺乏稳固基础的政权。”
邦莫达形容，缺乏诚信的政治合作如同在泥地上建屋，表面看似成立，但终究难以经得起考验。
他呼吁沙巴人民，特别是年轻选民，把握机会重新审视政治选择。
他说，国阵曾经执政沙巴，也曾被考验，如今他们带着改革决心回来，不是重复过去，而是为了做得更好。
“国阵不会再重蹈覆辙。我们已从过去学习，人民也亲眼目睹缺乏真诚基础的政治联盟只会产生不稳、缺乏方向与信任的政府。”

BACHOK: Pas masih memerlukan khidmat Ahli Parlimen Marang, Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang menerajui parti itu bagi mengharungi arena politik negara yang semakin mencabar.
  Setiausaha Agung Parti Amanah Negara (Amanah), Muhammad Faiz Fadzil bagaimanapun berkata, semua itu bergantung kepada ahli Pas untuk membuat keputusan berhubung perkara tersebut.
  “Saya mengambil pendekatan untuk tidak mencampuri urusan pemilihan parti politik lain selari dengan arahan diterima daripada pucuk pimpinan Amanah.
  “Namun, secara peribadi saya berasakan khidmat Tok Guru (Abdul Hadi) masih diperlukan di sebalik keuzuran Ahli Parlimen Marang itu yang dipersoal oleh pelbagai pihak. Saya amat hormat kerana beliau merupakan rakan baik arwah ayah saya yang juga bekas Presiden Pas, Allahyarham Datuk Fadzil Noor,” katanya  selepas Majlis Ramah Mesra Madani Pengerusi Lembaga Kemajuan Ikan Malaysia (LKIM) Bersama Nelayan Kelantan dan Perasmian Porrtable Container System (PCS) di Pantai Baru, Melawi, di sini hari ini.
  Muhammad Faiz berkata, secara peribadi mahu mengekalkan hubungan baik dengan Abdul Hadi di sebalik perbezaan fahaman politik dan mendoakan kesihatan pemimpin tertinggi Pas itu. 
  Dalam perkembangan lain, beliau yang juga Lembaga Kemajuan Ikan Malaysia (LKIM) berkata, lembaga itu akan menggunakan aplikasi digital melalui telefon pintar untuk mengagihkan subsidi minyak kepada hampir 40,000 nelayan di seluruh negara tidak lama lagi.
  Katanya, ia bagi menggantikan penggunaan peranti pembantu digital peribadi (PDA) sekali gus menyahut seruan kerajaan yang menekankan kepentingan peralihan ke arah pendigitalan.
  Menurutnya, PDA merupakan peranti bagi mengesahkan kelayakan seseorang mendapat subsidi dan jumlah minyak sepatutnya diterima.
  “Dalam masa terdekat kita akan dapat melaksanakan kaedah penyaluran subsidi minyak secara digital, iaitu menggunakan aplikasi dalam telefon pintar masing-masing dan tidak lagi menggunakan kaedah PDA.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 — Umno will remain in the federal government to continue championing the Malay and Bumiputera agenda, said party deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan.
  He described the decision as a strategic move, warning that exiting the government would simply allow another party to take its place.
  “If we leave, another party will fill the gap within two hours. We don’t want to be spectators on the sidelines. It is better to be in government, where we can drive new agendas suited to today’s realities,” he said.
  Mohamad, who is also the Member of Parliament for Rembau, was speaking after officiating the Cheras Umno division delegates meeting here today.
  He cited Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) as one of the party’s key focus areas.
  Although the portfolio is traditionally under the Human Resources Ministry, he said Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had taken the lead in addressing gaps, particularly affecting Malay youths.
  “Many are not dropping out because they failed exams, but because they never sat for them. That’s why we introduced the National TVET Policy, the National Tahfiz Policy and several other initiatives,” he said.
  Mohamad added that Umno was undertaking internal reforms to adapt to a shifting political landscape, following setbacks in the 2022 general election.
  “The political reality now is that no party, anywhere in the world, can govern alone. That era has ended.
  “We must be realistic. Although we have 192 divisions, our strategy should focus on constituencies we can win. Political idealism can be misleading and dangerous,” he said.
  He also expressed pride in Umno’s internal unity, saying it was one of the few stable parties in the country.
  “No one will support a party that’s in disarray. We must maintain harmony and project ourselves as a moderate, peaceful force,” he added. — Bernama

PERMATANG PAUH, June 15 (Bernama) -- UMNO leadership at the branch and division levels must play a vital role in gaining the support of voters aged under 40 so that the party remains the choice in the upcoming elections, said UMNO Supreme Council member Datuk Seri Dr Shamsul Anuar Nasarah.
  He said this group of voters is highly critical, more open, and dynamic and seeks a party that is genuinely seen as capable of offering the best for their future.
  "UMNO division and branch leadership must consider how to ensure UMNO remains as the best party while also projecting a positive image to gain the support of young people," he said after officiating the 2025 Permatang Pauh Women, Youth, and Puteri delegates' meetings held here today.
  The Deputy Home Minister said if UMNO succeeds in gaining support from the Malay community and the younger generation, the party could rise again to become the dominant political party in the country.
  "…it means we have to win many seats. Regarding the distribution of seats and which constituencies to contest in, we leave it to the party leadership," he said.
  Shamsul Anuar said UMNO must remain proactive in responding to the people's concerns to stay relevant and be seen as a party that matters.
  He said UMNO's focus is to prepare the party in all aspects in preparation for the state elections in Sabah, Melaka, and Johor, as well as the next General Election.

KUALA LUMPUR: As media organisations embark on digital transformation, the government is stepping in with support through a RM30mil fund to aid them in such efforts. 
  Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim made the announcement yesterday in conjunction with National Journalists Day (Hawana) 2025. 
  “We want to ensure the journalism world is not left behind in adopting artificial intelligence while also maintaining a balance between AI and ethics,” he said during his speech at Hawana 2025 at the World Trade Centre Kuala Lumpur yesterday. 
  “The government has agreed to allocate RM30mil for journalists. This is the largest allocation the government has provided for journalists since Merdeka,” he said, adding that the fund would be used for training.
  He said the journalism fraternity must strike a balance between the development of technology and journalistic ethics.
  Press freedom must be defended as it is one of the pillars of democracy, he said.
  Citing  American philosopher Noam Chomsky, he said there are some challenges in the form of manufacturing consent, whereby the tools of power are used to create a narrative.
  “Journalists and media leaders have to ensure that while we reject manufacturing consent, we must also reject manufacturing dissent,” he said. 
  He said that as much as one would not want the “tyranny of the majority” where power is used to oppress, the tyranny of the minority which divides the country is also not wanted. 
  Anwar also acknowledged some of the criticisms he has received, adding that some of his government’s measures may not be seen as popular.
  This includes the push for higher wages in the government and corporate sector. 
  However, he remains firm in his commitment to weed out corruption and steering reforms, although it may take some time. 
  “I will do my job regardless of whether I have the general support or not,” he said. 
  Anwar emphasised that his intention is not to incarcerate people but to recoup money squandered through corruption and use it for the betterment of the people.
  He highlighted that in a tradition where corruption was endemic and systemic, his government has initiated reforms, including proper tender and award of projects and enacting new legislation such as the Public Finance and Fiscal Responsibility Act.
  “It sounds simple, to most of you, but it is not easy. Many are not comfortable. Those who are used to the old ways,” he added.
  “When we have taken action against those corrupt leaders, past or present leaders, businessmen, corporate leaders who have squandered billions of ringgit, I have not seen that sort of anger and support that we should have. But it does not matter,” he said.
  At a press conference later, Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil said that the RM30mil fund is meant to help media organisations navigate the changing journalism landscape.
  He said the changes included the shift of the interests of news audiences and emergence of technologies.
  Also present were Star Media Group chief content officer Datin Paduka Esther Ng and chief news editor Mazwin Nik Anis.

  KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 (Bernama) -- The National Journalists’ Day (HAWANA) 2025, now in its fifth edition, continues to be a platform for championing the journalism profession while acting as a catalyst for a more progressive and responsible media transformation.
  Carrying the theme ‘Journalism in the New Era: Embracing AI, Safeguarding Ethics’, the HAWANA 2025 celebration highlight yesterday marked a historic moment with the immediate enforcement of the Malaysian Media Council (MMC) Act 2024 and the announcement of 12 members of MMC’s Founding Board.
  The announcement was made by Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil before 1,000 local and international media practitioners at the event officiated by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. Also present were Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Federal Territories) Datuk Seri Dr Zaliha Mustafa and Deputy Communications Minister Teo Nie Ching.
  Among the attendees were Communications Ministry Secretary-General Datuk Mohamad Fauzi Md Isa, Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) Chairman Datuk Seri Wong Chun Wai, Bernama Chief Executive Officer Datin Paduka Nur-ul Afida Kamaludin, and Bernama Editor-in-Chief Arul Rajoo Durar Raj, who is also HAWANA 2025 Project Director.
  The enforcement of the Act marks the culmination of years of discussions to establish a self-regulatory body that empowers media practitioners while ensuring accountability and addressing public concerns over media practices.
  Responding to the voices of the media community, HAWANA 2025 also saw the continuation of the Self-Employment Social Security Scheme (SKSPS) under the Social Security Organisation (PERKESO) for freelance media workers.
  First announced during HAWANA in Sarawak last year, the scheme is extended this year with an allocation of RM37,170.
  This initiative made possible through the synergy between Bernama and PERKESO, has so far benefited 531 freelance media workers.
  The government’s commitment to ensuring no media practitioner is left out of a social safety net also continues with i-Saraan contributions to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), involving an allocation of RM15,930.
  Other good news announced at the HAWANA 2025 on Saturday included a one-off 50% discount offer on return airfares to any of the 57 ASEAN destinations exclusively for Malaysian Media Card holders. Bookings can be made until Dec 31, 2025, with travel period from April to September 2026.
  This initiative, a strategic collaboration between the Communications Ministry and AirAsia, is being held in conjunction with Malaysia’s ASEAN Chairmanship in 2025.
  “Thank you AirAsia for the generous initiative,” said Fahmi when announcing the offer.
  Adding to the excitement, AirAsia co-founder and Capital A Bhd chief executive officer Tan Sri Tony Fernandes also announced that an aircraft will be named after a journalist and feature custom aircraft liveries as a tribute to the role and contributions of media professionals to ASEAN communities.
  Meanwhile, the Prime Minister announced a RM30 million allocation for local media organisations for digital transformation and new technology adoption, describing it as the largest-ever government allocation for the media since independence.
  In line with the rapid development of technology including artificial intelligence (AI), this allocation is expected to support training and help ensure journalists are not left behind in the AI race, while also reinforcing the balance between AI and ethics.
  Saturday's ceremony also saw the late Rozaid Abdul Rahman, former director of Media and Strategic Communications at the Prime Minister’s Office, posthumously awarded the HAWANA 2025 Special Award.
  The HAWANA 2025 Award was presented to Malaysian Press Institute (MPI) president Datuk Yong Soo Heong in recognition of his life-long contributions to journalism.
  Three veteran journalists – News Desk Editor at The Star Ng Li Yiao, 56; former Karangkraf staffer Rusmin Fadzil, 62; and Makkal Osai Editor Murugan Perumal, 67 – were recipients of contributions from the Kasih@HAWANA Fund, presented by the Prime Minister.
  Since its launch at HAWANA 2023 in Ipoh, Perak, the Kasih@HAWANA Fund has benefitted 441 media practitioners nationwide with contributions exceeding RM1.2 million.
  At the same ceremony, the Prime Minister was presented with a copy of 'From a Rented Bungalow – The Bernama Story', by Wong, a 288-page volume documenting the founding history of Bernama.
  HAWANA 2025’s intellectual segment also drew attention, with the HAWANA Forum 2025 addressing the topic “Malaysian Media Council: Regulator or Media Protector?”, and a technology sharing session titled “AI & Media: Tool, Threat or Opportunity?” – both sparking key discourse on the evolving role of the media in today’s fast-changing digital landscape.
  This year’s celebration began on May 31 with the inaugural HAWANA-DBP Pantun Festival at Wisma Bernama – held to highlight the beauty of traditional Malay poetry among media practitioners.
  The celebration also features the HAWANA 2025 Carnival at Sunway Putra Mall over three days beginning Friday, targeting 5,000 visitors and showcasing 20 exhibition booths involving major media agencies, government departments and private sector entities.
  HAWANA 2025 continues today with a line-up of meaningful programmes, including a media sports event featuring traditional games and a roadshow to premier polytechnics in Selangor, Perak and Johor to cultivate youth interest in journalism and the media industry.
  To ensure the success of HAWANA 2025, nearly 100 strategic partners came forward with support and sponsorships – a significant increase from 44 last year – reflecting growing recognition of the HAWANA “brand” not only among government departments and agencies but also within the corporate sector.
  The successful organisation of HAWANA 2025 by the Ministry of Communications through Bernama as the implementing agency reaffirms the continued relevance and dynamism of Malaysia’s media industry in facing the challenges of the digital age.
  HAWANA was first introduced in 2018 as a tribute to journalists’ contributions to national development, with May 29 chosen to commemorate the publication of the first edition of Utusan Melayu in 1939.

  To ensure the success of HAWANA 2025, nearly 100 strategic partners came forward with support and sponsorships – a significant increase from 44 last year – reflecting growing recognition of the HAWANA “brand” not only among government departments and agencies but also within the corporate sector.
  The successful organisation of HAWANA 2025 by the Ministry of Communications through Bernama as the implementing agency reaffirms the continued relevance and dynamism of Malaysia’s media industry in facing the challenges of the digital age.
  HAWANA was first introduced in 2018 as a tribute to journalists’ contributions to national development, with May 29 chosen to commemorate the publication of the first edition of Utusan Melayu in 1939.

表示，在数字与人工智能时代，一些媒体为了争取流量往往会使用破坏种族和谐的耸动标题，昨天正式成立的首届马来西亚
媒体理事会
将成为一个重要平台，为大众厘清模糊的
新闻守则
。
她认同现今的媒体面对很大的挑战，似乎已演变成“流量为王”的局面，而新闻处理是否符合新闻守则，就交由媒体理事会厘清，帮助大众了解什么是有素质的新闻报道，同时制定媒体工作者的职业规范和行为守则与指南。

也是古来国会议员的她，昨晚出席马来西亚德教联合总会与《星洲日报》主催、古来德教会紫霭阁举办的“百善孝为先——父母恩、子女情——爱吾双亲”联欢晚宴后，接受媒体访问时如是指出。
她表示，她对媒体理事会抱有很大的期许，制定标准的工作就交给媒体工作者与非政府组织代表组成的理事会。
“毕竟我们不是这领域的专家，新闻道德守则由政府制定并不合适，因此媒体理事会这个平台很重要。”
她强调，媒体理事会是一个中立的机构，首届理事阵容由12人组成，当中包括媒体与非政府组织代表，他们也会负责处理公众对新闻的投诉，并通过听证会等方式听取各方的意见。
她相信，媒体理事会将有助解决媒体行业中的问题和纠纷，以判断有关新闻报道是否违反新闻守则。
她也在致词时披露，媒体理事会的概念早在50年前提出，但一直没有落实，直到2019年在时任通讯部长哥宾星推动下，成立了临时委员会并拟定媒体理事会草案，后来2020年发生喜来登行动和经历了两次政权转移，导致计划被搁置。
她坦言，如今首届媒体理事会的正式成立，让她百感交集，而相关法案的80%至90%内容，皆源自当初临时委员会所拟定的草案。
出席者包括紫霭阁阁长拿督陈益昇、副阁长兼“爱吾双亲”联欢晚宴筹委会主席余芩蒂。

LUMUT, June 15 (Bernama) -- The Malaysian Media Council (MMC) Act, which came into effect yesterday (June 14), marks the most significant reform in the country’s journalism landscape, realised under the MADANI Government.
  Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil said the MADANI Government had succeeded in realising the establishment of the Malaysian Media Council (MMC) after nearly 50 years of anticipation among media practitioners.
  “This is the most significant reform that we (MADANI Government) have introduced. With the establishment of the Media Council, media organisations can now independently and freely deliberate on matters such as journalistic ethics and the future of the media in our country, without interference or influence from any party, including the government,” he said.
  “For us, especially our colleagues in Keadilan (PKR) within Pakatan Harapan, as well as our friends in UMNO who have long championed media freedom, this has become a reality with the establishment of the Media Council,” he said.
  He was speaking at the Communications Minister and the MADANI Community session, held in conjunction with the Northern Zone B Akademi Asas Penerangan (ASAS) programme organised by the Department of Information (JaPen) at Universiti Kuala Lumpur Malaysian Institute of Marine Engineering Technology (UniKL-MIMET) here today.
  Also present were Communications Ministry secretary-general Datuk Mohamad Fauzi Md Isa and JaPen director-general Julina Johan.
  Fahmi, at a press conference following the National Journalists' Day (HAWANA) 2025 main celebration at the World Trade Centre Kuala Lumpur (WTCKL) yesterday, announced that the Malaysian Media Council (MMC) Act would come into effect on June 14, 2025.
  He also announced that he would soon hold a meeting with the 12 members of the MMC founding board to assist in shaping the council’s next steps and future activities.
  The three-day HAWANA 2025 celebration, which concludes today, is organised by the Ministry of Communications, with the Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) as the implementing agency.
  The date May 29 was gazetted as National Journalists’ Day to commemorate the publication of the first edition of “Utusan Melayu” newspaper on May 29, 1939, honouring the contributions and services of media professionals as vital agents in shaping an informed society.

:
Akta Majlis Media Malaysia (MMM) yang berkuat kuasa semalam merupakan satu reformasi paling bermakna dalam landskap kewartawanan negara yang direalisasikan menerusi kerajaan Madani.
Menteri Komunikasi Fahmi Fadzil berkata kerajaan Madani berjaya merealisasikan penubuhan MMM setelah 50 tahun pengamal media mengharapkan majlis itu diwujudkan.
“Ini adalah reformasi paling besar yang kita (kerajaan Madani) bawa. Adanya Majlis Media Malaysia bermaksud organisasi media boleh membincangkan isu-isu sama ada etika kewartawanan ataupun masa depan media dalam negara kita secara sendiri, berdikari, bebas tanpa diganggu ataupun dipengaruh oleh mana-mana pihak termasuk kerajaan.
“Kita, terutama kawan-kawan dalam PKR, dalam Pakatan Harapan, malah juga kawan-kawan dalam Umno yang sentiasa perjuangkan kebebasan media, perkara itu (kebebasan media) telah menjadi satu realiti dengan terbentuknya majlis media ini,” katanya.
Beliau berkata demikian pada Sesi Menteri Komunikasi Bersama Komuniti Madani sempena Program Akademi Asas Penerangan Zon Utara B anjuran Jabatan Penerangan di Universiti Kuala Lumpur Malaysian Institute of Marine Engineering Technology (UniKL-MIMET).
Pada sidang media selepas Majlis Kemuncak Hari Wartawan Nasional (Hawana) 2025 di Pusat Dagangan Dunia Kuala Lumpur di Kuala Lumpur semalam, Fahmi mengumumkan Akta MMM mula berkuat kuasa pada 14 Jun 2025.
Fahmi turut memaklumkan beliau akan mengadakan pertemuan dengan 12 anggota Lembaga Pengasas MMM dalam masa terdekat bagi membantu proses membangunkan majlis berkenaan.
Sambutan Hawana 2025 dianjurkan oleh Kementerian Komunikasi dengan Bernama selaku agensi pelaksana, bertujuan mengiktiraf peranan dan sumbangan pengamal media dalam pembangunan negara.
Tarikh 29 Mei diwartakan sebagai Hari Wartawan Nasional bersempena penerbitan edisi pertama akhbar Utusan Melayu pada 29 Mei 1939, bagi meraikan sumbangan pemain industri yang menjadi medium dalam membentuk minda masyarakat bermaklumat.

KOTA KINABALU, June 15 (Bernama) -- The Malaysian Media Council (MMC) marks a historic milestone, fulfilling a 50-year vision first proposed by Tun Abdul Razak Hussein, which stakeholders have hailed as a turning point for media self-regulation.
  MMC founding board member Datuk Sardahthisa James said the establishment represented a paradigm shift in media governance, enabling industry players to set their ethical standards and best practices while fostering constructive collaboration with the government.  
  "It does not mean that the government is abdicating its role in regulating the media, as it will always be needed to navigate an environment that considers certain matters sensitive.
  "What the MMC does is provide an opportunity for the media to be constructive and work with the government on what these good practices should constitute," the Daily Express editor-in-chief told Bernama today.
  The MMC Act took effect yesterday, with Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil announcing the council's 12-member founding board at the HAWANA 2025 celebration main event, which Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim officiated at the Kuala Lumpur World Trade Centre.
  James noted that while the late Tun Abdul Razak's original vision for the MMC focused on guiding media operations, he could not have anticipated the way digital media and Generative AI would revolutionise information, helping people make informed decisions.
  "Therefore, the MMC must now develop strategies to navigate these challenges and propose solutions that serve Malaysian media while meeting public expectations," he said.
  He added that the MMC's immediate challenge lies in addressing the impact of emerging technologies, including digital media and Generative AI, on information dissemination while developing acceptable guidelines for Malaysian media practitioners.
  James, who is also a member of the Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) Board of Governors, highlighted the council's inclusive nature, noting significant representation from East Malaysian media, particularly from Sabah, in line with the spirit of equal partnership enshrined in the Malaysia Agreement, which determines journalistic standards.
  Meanwhile, Utusan Borneo Sabah editor-in-chief Datuk Lichong Angkui lauded the MADANI Government and Anwar for finally establishing MMC after decades of advocacy from industry stakeholders.
  "Certainly, the HAWANA 2025 stage has become a historic moment for us, the media fraternity, to celebrate with smiles of joy as the dream of seeing this council formed has finally become a reality," he said.
  Lichong expressed hope that the MMC would not only serve as a regulatory body but, more importantly, as a strong, independent, and inclusive protector in preserving the integrity and freedom of the media in this country.
  Tawau Journalists and Media Practitioners Association (Pewarta) deputy chairman Tamrin Jamil said the MMC's establishment is timely to safeguard the local media industry amid rapid technological advancements.
  "MMC not only functions as a regulatory body but also as a crucial support system for local media agencies and practitioners," he said, adding that the establishment reflects the MADANI Government's commitment to implementing institutional reform.
  "It also serves as a mechanism to rebuild public trust in the media by promoting media literacy and ethical journalism," he added.
  Veteran journalist Lagatah Toyos of the Daily Express said the MMC could further consolidate Malaysia's media industry, particularly local outlets in Sabah, allowing them to remain resilient, relevant, and credible despite the challenges of the modern era.
  "MMC is also expected to help restore public trust in the journalism profession while prioritising the welfare and safety of media practitioners, regardless of whether they are from government or private media," she added.

KOTA KINABALU: The Sabah Journalists Association (SJA) has urged the government to ensure that its latest digital transformation initiative for the media is inclusive, practical and results-driven.
  This is especially important for journalists in Sabah and Sarawak who often face unique on-the-ground challenges, said SJA president Mariah Doksil.
  In welcoming the Federal Government’s RM30mil allocation for digital transformation in the media sector, she added the move was a timely recognition of journalism’s evolving role in an increasingly digital and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven landscape.
  However, Mariah stressed that meaningful engagement with state-level media organisations must not be treated as an afterthought
  “Sabah and Sarawak’s inclusion must not be tokenistic. There must be clear KPIs to assess whether or not these programmes truly reach and benefit journalists (across the nation),” she said in a statement on Sunday (June 15).
  ALSO READ:  Govt to allocate RM30mil for media digital transformation, says Anwar 
  Mariah added that the allocation is a valuable opportunity for media practitioners to upskill and embrace new storytelling tools, provided that training is accessible and tailored to the diverse needs of journalists.
  “In a world increasingly shaped by AI, journalists must remain ethical, factually accurate, and, most importantly, human in their storytelling. These programmes should help ensure that our work retains its jiwa, the soul and empathy that define meaningful journalism,” she said.
  Mariah stressed the importance of proper consultation with local media bodies such as SJA to ensure that no one is left behind.
  The RM30mil allocation was announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim when officiating the National Journalists’ Day (HAWANA) 2025 celebration at the World Trade Centre in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday (June 14).
  The funds are intended to support digital transformation and the adoption of new technologies in the media industry.
  Mariah said that while the allocation is a step in the right direction, it must be translated into meaningful and measurable outcomes, not just for major media players in the peninsula, but for every journalist striving to tell stories from the rural and remote corners of Malaysia.
  ALSO READ: Fahmi announces founding board members of Malaysian Media Council 
  Meanwhile, on the government’s move to enhance social protection for local and national stringers – part-time or freelance journalists – through the Social Security Organisation (PERKESO) and Employees Provident Fund (EPF) i-Saraan contributions, Mariah welcomed it but called for clarity in its implementation.
  “Local stringers are the backbone of rural coverage, while national stringers bridge regional voices with the national narrative. These are necessary steps to safeguard their livelihoods, but the process must be straightforward and accessible,” she said.
  Mariah also proposed the creation of a centralised database to keep track of stringers across the country, an initiative she believes will help provide structured and targeted support.
  “Of our 115 active members, around 20% are stringers. A dedicated platform would go a long way towards ensuring that their contributions are properly recognised and their needs adequately addressed,” she added.
  On Saturday, Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil announced that social security protection for stringers would be expanded under both PERKESO and EPF.

The enforcement of the Act marks the culmination of years of discussions to establish a self-regulatory body that empowers media practitioners while ensuring accountability and addressing public concerns over media practices.
Responding to the voices of the media community, HAWANA 2025 also saw the continuation of the Self-Employment Social Security Scheme (SKSPS) under the Social Security Organisation (PERKESO) for freelance media workers.
First announced during HAWANA in Sarawak last year, the scheme is extended this year with an allocation of RM37,170.
This initiative made possible through the synergy between Bernama and PERKESO, has so far benefited 531 freelance media workers.


The government’s commitment to ensuring no media practitioner is left out of a social safety net also continues with i-Saraan contributions to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), involving an allocation of RM15,930.
Other good news announced at the HAWANA 2025 on Saturday included a one-off 50% discount offer on return airfares to any of the 57 ASEAN destinations exclusively for Malaysian Media Card holders. Bookings can be made until Dec 31, 2025, with travel periodfrom April to September 2026.
This initiative, a strategic collaboration between the Communications Ministry and AirAsia, is being held in conjunction with Malaysia’s ASEAN Chairmanship in 2025.
“Thank you AirAsia for the generous initiative,” said Fahmi whenannouncing the offer.
Adding to the excitement, AirAsia co-founder and Capital A Bhd chief executive officer Tan Sri Tony Fernandes also announced that an aircraft will be named after a journalist and feature custom aircraft liveries as a tribute to the role andcontributions of media professionals to ASEAN communities.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister announced a RM30 million allocation for local media organisations for digital transformation and new technology adoption, describing it as the largest-ever government allocation for the media since independence.
In line with the rapid development of technology including artificial intelligence (AI), this allocation is expected to support training and help ensure journalists are not left behind in the AI race, while also reinforcing the balance between AI and ethics.
Saturday's ceremony also saw the late Rozaid Abdul Rahman, former director of Media and Strategic Communications at the Prime Minister’s Office, posthumously awarded the HAWANA 2025 Special Award.
The HAWANA 2025 Award was presented to Malaysian Press Institute (MPI) president Datuk Yong Soo Heong in recognition of his life-long contributions to journalism.
Three veteran journalists – News Desk Editor at The Star Ng Li Yiao, 56; former Karangkraf staffer Rusmin Fadzil, 62; and Makkal Osai Editor Murugan Perumal, 67 – were recipients of contributions from the Kasih@HAWANA Fund, presented by the Prime Minister.

The successful organisation of HAWANA 2025 by the Ministry of Communications through Bernama as the implementing agency reaffirms the continued relevance and dynamism of Malaysia’s media industry in facing the challenges of the digital age.

KUALA LUMPUR: Beginning January next year, all private schools, colleges and training centres will be exempted from paying their education levies, says Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
  The Prime Minister said the exemption will apply across the board and include preschools, primary, secondary and vocational schools, higher education providers and training centres.
  “This is the first time in history that the government is exempting the education levy for a full year. 
  “We have received numerous appeals from education and training institutions asking for relief from this payment,” he said in his keynote speech at the National Training Week 2025 summit here yesterday.
  Also present at the event was Human Resources Minister Steven Sim. 
  The initiative, which will run from Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2026, will benefit 1,668 institutions and see the government forgo RM46mil in levies.
  Anwar, who is also the Finance Minister, said the move is aimed at allowing these institutions to fully focus on improving the quality of their training and education.
  “Our children must be given the best training possible. The government will find the necessary mechanisms and funding to support this effort,” he said.
  He also instructed the secretaries-general of both the Education Ministry and the Human Resources Ministry to closely monitor these institutions to ensure they are delivering top-tier training.
  “On top of that, I urge them to also monitor high-profit private companies. They must be prepared to give back, even a little, to their workers,” Anwar said.
  The exemption applies only to private institutions following the government’s move to expand the 6% service tax to private education services beginning July 2025.

PETALING JAYA: At a time when it’s common to delay marriage and kids, some men have gone against the grain, choosing to start their family early as they view fatherhood as a blessing in life.
  Welcoming his baby daughter at 24, Mu'aadz Emran said it was always in his plans to graduate, then marry and start his own family at a young age.
  “Some believe they will wait until they are ready or more financially stable to have kids, but at what point do we decide that we are ready enough?
  “For me, if we have a suitable and supportive partner, I believe one should just go along the parenting journey and face challenges that come along the way together,” said the sales executive, now aged 26.
  Mu'aadz and his wife Adilah Abdul Azmil with their two-year-old daughter Yusra
  As with other parents, Mu’aadz sometimes faces challenges in juggling his duties at home and work.
  “For now, I’m the sole breadwinner so we have to adjust our lifestyle according to our means.
  “But there are ways to make it work,” he said.
  Mu’aadz is part of the growing number of young fathers in Malaysia over recent years.
  Data from the Department of Statistics Malaysia has shown that there has been an 8% spike in newborn babies with fathers aged 24 and below - from 25,707 in 2021 to 27,798 in 2023.
  Marketing executive Yusuf Zamani also had similar plans to start a family early, embracing fatherhood at 25 when his wife delivered a baby boy.
  Yusuf and his wife Nurul Shahizan Rudzuanazmi and their children Ya’qub, three, and five-month-old Yusra
  “Building a family, to me, is a big thing in life, just like pursuing a dream career.
  “My family is my main motivator to keep achieving more success.
  “Of course, I struggle sometimes trying to cope with work, family life and my volunteering activities at an NGO.
  “I can still do everything, but we have to give and take. That’s just life,” said the marketing executive, now 28 and a father of two.
  Father of three girls, Chong Hua Chean was 26 when his eldest daughter was born.
  Now at 37, he believes that being a dad has shifted his priorities towards family life, giving him a more grounded mindset.
  “I feel grateful to be a young father, as it gives me the opportunity to spend more quality time with my children and to be present for more of life’s journey with each of my daughters,” said Chong, a manager at a multinational company.
  Chong and his wife Christine Tan (second from right), with their daughters (from left) Qaai Naa, seven, Qaai Niing, four and Qaai Nee, 12
  One of the most heartwarming moments Chong treasures was when his daughter prepared a Father’s Day card and gift for him.
  “To all new and young fathers: there’s no such thing as a perfect parent.
  “Don’t be too hard on yourself or your children.
  “Embrace the journey, cherish the moments, and value the time spent with your loved ones,” he added.
  Father-to-be, Muhammad Faris Idris, 29, believes that becoming a dad is one of the most meaningful experiences in life.
  “I’m excited and grateful to take on this role and grow into it with love and responsibility,” said the bank senior executive analyst, who will be expecting his first child this year.
  Getting hitched at the age of 24, he and his wife have been trying to start a family for several years before finally being blessed with a child.
  Ahead of his baby’s arrival, Muhammad Faris said he has been preparing himself by buying all necessary items, attending parenting classes, reading and learning about fatherhood.
  “I’m also managing my finances wisely, making sure we have the right medical coverage and savings in case of emergencies,” he said.
  Father of two, Siemens Yee said he has been “catching his breath” ever since he became a dad at 28.
  “I’ve got two boys — full of energy and questions,” said the finance controller, now 34, whose sons are six and four.
  Yee said he planned to retire early and give his children the best of his time and energy while he was still relatively young.
  “Being around as they grow up — fully present — means everything to me,” he added.
  Yee and his wife Xindi Yong with their two boys, Wyatt, six (second from left) and Elliot, four (right).
  It wasn’t always easy, but Yee said he was blessed to have a loving and supportive wife, and was grateful for the incredible help from their extended family.
  He said the best part about starting a family early is the bond his children are building with their grandparents.
  “There’s something magical about seeing your kids laugh with your parents,” he said.
  Another soon-to-be father, who wishes to be known only as Affzan, 29, said he and his wife were very excited about their journey ahead with their baby expected to be born this year.
  "Currently, we are trying our best to grow our finances as much as possible,” said the occupation project analyst.
  As he waits to become a dad, Affzan said he was preparing himself spiritually, mentally and physically.
  “I need to set a good example and be the best role model for our child,” he said.
  For this Father’s Day, he said the plan was to pamper his wife instead.
  “Without her, I wouldn't be a husband nor a father-to-be, so I will be cooking a nice dinner at home to show what a good father I can become,” Affzan said.
  A father of two who wishes to be known only as Ben, 32 said parenting isn’t about providing for the kids financially, but about being present and guiding them through life.
  “These things can only happen when you invest a lot of time together, and starting young gives me that opportunity,” said the product manager, who became a dad at 26.
  He shared that as a father, there was a fear of messing up.
  “Being a young dad while still figuring out my own adulthood isn’t easy,” he said.
  Since children learn more by watching their parents’ actions, Ben said he tries to be honest, humble, and willing to grow.
  “I want to show them it’s okay to make mistakes, as long as we keep moving further upwards and onwards,” he said, adding that his wife also played a crucial role as the anchor in their family.
  
------------------------------
PETALING JAYA: They’re in their early twenties — some fresh out of school — but more young men in Malaysia are becoming fathers, with the data showing an 8% spike in dads aged 24 and below.
  The number of newborn babies with fathers in such a young age group kept increasing - from 25,707 in 2021 to 27,798 in 2023, based on data from the Department of Statistics Malaysia.
  Unplanned pregnancies aside, experts say other reasons for this trend are youths having a change in mindset on family life and financial stability, influence from social media, as well as religious and cultural factors.
  “While some pregnancies are unplanned, others are intentional.
  “Many couples now choose to complete their families early to enjoy greater freedom and improved quality of life during their 40s and retirement years,” said Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Malaysia (OGSM) honorary secretary Dr Loh Huey Wen.
  Below is a view of the trend which has kept growing since 2021:
  Calling it a significant shift, Dr Loh said social media has played a powerful role in reshaping perceptions of youths.
  "Social media often features young parents sharing glimpses into family life, portraying parenthood as rewarding.
  “Another contributing factor could be the evolving concept of financial stability.
  “Unlike previous generations, many young men today may receive substantial support from their families — whether in the form of housing, childcare or direct financial aid.
  “This results in a greater sense of security,” she said when contacted ahead of Father’s Day today (June 15).
  As a result, owning a home or reaching a certain income level, may no longer be prerequisites for starting a family, said Dr Loh, who is a consultant obstetrician, gynaecologist and fertility specialist.
  Better Dads Malaysia (BDM) co-founder and advisor Jason Leong said a study in 2023 showed that some early marriages correlated with traditional expectations around starting a family young.
  “Religious or cultural motivations or family child raising arrangements can influence family planning.
  “We know of young couples who believe that it is easier for them to have children early, especially when they can let their own parents or in-laws who are still fairly strong and healthy to help look after their children,” said Leong.
  As such, early fatherhood is not necessarily accidental but a conscious life choice rooted in values involving family, convenience and legacy.
  Where are Malaysia’s young dads?
  Most states and territories in Malaysia, or 10 out of 16, showed an uptick in fresh faced dads from 2021 to 2023.
  Selangor recorded the highest number of babies born to fathers aged 24 and below in 2023 with 3,974 newborns.
  This is followed by Sabah with 3,683 and Johor with 3,302.
  Only six states showed either a decline or unclear trends from 2021 to 2023.
  The six states are Perak, Kelantan, Pahang, Terengganu, Labuan and Putrajaya.
  You can view the trend in your state by clicking on the dropbox in the graph below:
  However, Sarawak was the state with the highest proportion of babies born to young dads out of the total number of newborns there.
  About 8.7% of the babies in the state had fathers aged 24 and below in 2023, followed by Sabah with 7.9%, and Perlis with 7.7%.
  Here’s a closer look at the percentages for each state and territory:
  At BDM, Leong said the non-profit organisation received a “modest but clear increase” in younger fathers reaching out through its digital platforms and attendance in its awareness talks in schools.
  “There are young fathers and even young, single men participating in our fathering workshops.
  “To us, this is a good development as their interest shows that they want to learn and prepare early for fatherhood,” he added.
  Across ethnic groups, young fathers were most prevalent among the non-Malay Bumiputras.
  Men aged 24 and below made up 10% of the fathers to newborn babies within the community in 2023.
  Among the Malay community, such young fathers comprised 6%, followed by Indians at 5% and Chinese at 3%.
  While men aged 24 and below made up 6.1% of the total Malaysian fathers in 2023, the majority of dads in the country were in their early 30s.
  Of the total 455,761 newborn babies in 2023, some 30.6% had fathers aged between 30 and 34.
  This is followed by youths aged 25 to 29 who comprised 24.4% of the total.
  Below is an age breakdown of fathers in 2023:
  The good and bad of young fatherhood
  The rise of young fathers in Malaysia comes with both its benefits and challenges.
  Aside from financial constraints, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Datuk Dr NKS Tharmaseelan said another challenge young fathers may face is the lack of quality time with their family.
  “If both parents are working, quality time with children is at a premium.
  “Looking into children’s wants may also be a stress factor to an already stressed household.
  "Maturity, wisdom, and adaptation come with age,” he said.
  Nevertheless, being a young fathers has its perks too.
  For one, Dr Tharmaseelan said the narrower age gap allows for much easier bonding.
  “Young parents will generally be able to relate to their kids more fruitfully.
  “They sync better both physically, mentally and with their needs and wants, creating the possibility of a much closer relationship,” he said.
  Leong said young fathers also benefit from having higher energy and adaptability.
  “Young fathers often engage more physically and actively with their children, and adapt faster to new parenting knowledge or digital tools,” he said.
  From a public health aspect, Dr Loh said fatherhood at a younger age can help to address the national decline in fertility rates.
  “A man’s age plays a significant role—research shows that men over 40 are more likely to have reduced sperm quality.
  “There’s also an increased risk of passing on genetic mutations and certain rare genetic disorders,” she said.
  Reduced fertility among males is also on the rise, with growing evidence pointing to declines in sperm quality due to factors like lifestyle, stress, and environmental exposures, Dr Loh added.
  However, younger men are not immune to fertility issues either.
  “Poor lifestyle habits such as smoking, heavy drinking, poor diet, drug use, and lack of exercise can harm sperm quality even in men in their 20s and 30s,” she said.
  Conditions like obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, as well as exposure to heat or harmful chemicals, can also affect sperm health and increase the risk of miscarriage or complications during pregnancy.
  “It is essential that men of all ages take responsibility for their health before trying to conceive.
  “Simple steps like maintaining a healthy weight, eating well, avoiding harmful substances, and managing stress and chronic illness can make a significant difference - not just for fertility, but for the long-term health of their children,” she added.
  Dr Tharmaseelan said studies show that men over 45 face a 14% decrease in fertility rates each year, making it progressively difficult to conceive naturally.
  He said although there were occasional sensational reported cases of celebrities having fathered children like actor Al Pacino in his 80s, this was not the norm.
  “Men should know the challenges of delaying fatherhood.
  “You may not live long enough to see your child reach adulthood or even be able to spend quality time with them.
  “Supporting them too becomes difficult as you may be unemployed by the time they reach school-going age,” Dr Tharmaseelan added.
  Helping young dads cope
  To better support young fathers and families in general, more measures could be taken to help them.
  Leong said BDM suggests that Malaysia’s current paternity leave of seven days be extended to at least 14 days.
  “There should also be corporate tax deductions or incentives for companies that promote father-friendly or family-friendly policies.
  “This can include companies that conduct fathering workshops for their employees,” he said, adding that child support allowances could also be extended to lower-income young fathers.
  Concurring, Dr Loh said measures like extended, paid paternity leave can encourage early bonding and shared parenting.
  “Guidance and support can be provided by the formation of father-focused workshops and support groups.
  “Flexible work policies can provide opportunities for fathers to be more present at home,” she said, adding that financial incentives such as tax relief and childcare subsidies can ease the pressure of early parenthood.
  The increase in young fathers also highlighted the importance of equipping these young men with specific fathering skills for nurturing and leading, said Leong.
  “Fathers must know that they can be physically present but yet emotionally absent in their children’s lives,” he said.
  Leong said young fathers should be supported through policy, education and mentoring so that there will be healthier families and by extension, a more resilient nation.

早已成为普遍现象。母亲除了持家，也须在职场奋斗；而父亲，也必须学习在育儿中分担更多，甚至承担起传统上被认为是“母亲的工作”。
不少现代父亲在孩子的成长过程中扮演多重角色：一早起床准备早餐、送孩子上学，下班赶回家煮饭、洗澡、辅导功课、哄睡觉。有些父亲甚至会主动请育婴假，陪伴妻子与新生儿度过初生的艰难阶段。这一切改变，不仅是生活压力的结果，更是一种父职角色的觉醒和成熟。
在传统华人观念里，父亲像是一棵树，站得稳、说得少，却总能在风雨中为一家人撑起一片天。圣经也描述上帝像父亲一样，“父亲怎样怜恤儿女，耶和华也怎样怜恤敬畏他的人”。这是一幅温柔的画面，是情感与引导并重的父爱典范。
心理学研究也早已指出：父亲在家庭中的积极参与，对孩子的社交、学习、情绪管理与自信心建立具有不可替代的影响。反之，若孩子在成长过程中缺乏父爱，无论物质是否充足，都容易产生情感空洞与行为偏差。
马六甲近期发生的
弑母弑兄案
，令人痛心。这起案件涉及一个单亲家庭，初步调查指向母亲对孩子学业的过高期望所引发的压力。虽然具体原因尚待厘清，但单亲家庭中父亲角色的缺失，可能在某种程度上加剧了家庭关系的紧张。这提醒我们，父亲的存在不仅是经济支柱，更是一种情感的依靠。
笔者是两个孩子的父亲。大儿子是一位6岁的自闭症儿童，育儿对我而言，从来不是“父亲节广告”中光鲜的形象，而是一条满布泪水与挣扎、但也因着爱而不愿放弃的路。孩子的情绪崩溃、学习困难、睡眠障碍……这一切都深刻地提醒我：父亲的“存在”，远比“表现”更重要。而我要学习的，正是在这些时刻里成为一个安稳的避风港。
今天，许多年轻人不敢结婚、不愿生育，除了高房价、生活成本，更是因为他们看见育儿的不易，害怕自己撑不起一个家。在这样的时代背景下，愿我们给予父亲更多理解与肯定，也为每一个正在努力扮演好父职的人，点一盏光。

More and more fathers are taking a step back from their busy everyday life to reconnect with their children.
  Between demanding work schedules, financial pressures and the fast pace of daily routines, dads are choosing to be more present, carving out time for shared adventures through travel.
  Let’s dive into how these fathers are reshaping the traditional “authoritative” role in the family, prioritising active participation in their children’s lives.
  Modern fathers 
  For Dr Sharkawi Che Din, 54, a professor of computer animation at a local university, the decision to embark on regular travels with his son stemmed from a “void” he experienced in his own childhood.
  Growing up, Sharkawi rarely spent time with his father, who, like many men of his generation, viewed a father’s role as a mere financial provider.
  “My father was always working. He didn’t have the time or the mindset for family trips,” he recalls. “That absence stayed with me. So I made a promise that when I had my own child, I would do things differently.”
  And he has. For nearly a decade, the photography enthusiast and his now 18-year-old son, Afiq, have been going on photography expeditions across Malaysia together. From cool highland retreats to coastal fishing villages, they have captured the country’s beauty through their lenses.
  More importantly, they have built a strong bond that many fathers and sons rarely enjoy.
  Meanwhile, Azlan Andi, 34, has been exploring the world with his twin sons since they were just two years old. While most people associate gifts with something tangible, Azlan has a different point of view.
  “I believe the most precious gift we can give our children is time and memories,” he says.
  Azlan wants to be part of his children’s core memories by creating little moments with them.
  The content creator travels frequently and has made family adventures a priority. “My kids were invited as ‘baby influencers’,” he shares. “So travelling together eventually became a natural thing.”
  The family has set foot in more than 13 countries. Back home, they have explored every state in Malaysia. “I find domestic travel especially meaningful. Not only does it expose the kids to our country’s rich and diverse wonders, but it also strengthens their connection to the local culture,” Azlan says.
  Evan Lanier, 42, a photographer from the United States, began his travel adventures in a campervan, road-tripping through 46 states in the US with his four children. What started as a classic family road trip soon turned into international journeys to places like Guatemala, Ecuador and Papua New Guinea, sometimes with all six family members along for the ride.
  One especially eye-opening trip was to Malaysia, which he explored with just his son, Gray. Though brief, the visit sparked a realisation: He wants to keep discovering the world with his children.
  “A global worldview is something many children don’t get the chance to experience,” Evan explains. “Travel gives my kids that gift.”
  As for Ray Mak, 40, a YouTube artist and content creator, he started bringing his sons, Zac and Asher, on adventures abroad even before they could talk or walk, exploring beautiful places both within Malaysia and beyond.
  The initial motivation was to make the most of the flight discounts for children under a certain age.
  They went without expecting much, but it turned out to be “one of the best decisions” he has made as a parent.
  Each trip has given Mak a front-row seat to his children’s growth – watching them grow not just in size, but in confidence and awareness of the world around them.

  Being present 
  Sharkawi says that travelling with his son is about more than just seeing new places or taking photos. “It is about showing my son that being truly present matters,” he explains.
  He believes that being involved in their lives – including listening to them and growing with them – is crucial for their emotional and mental wellbeing.
  Their photos, often shared on social media and photography forums, have garnered plenty of attention and praise.
  For many, fatherhood is traditionally all about fulfilling duties – from providing for the family to instilling discipline – Sharkawi says. But today, he observes that more fathers are embracing an emotionally-present role.
  “That shift means building a deeper connection with my son through shared experiences rather than just responsibilities,” he says. “Being a father isn’t just about rules or routines any more.”
  From Vietnam to Japan to England, Azlan and his children have set foot in over 13 countries. — AZLAN ANDI
  Azlan agrees with Sharkawi that fathers are leaning into emotional connection, with technology and flexible schedules making things easier now.
  “It’s the accessibility,” Azlan says.
  Although he didn’t travel with his own father when he was young, Azlan still holds deep respect for him. “I remember how much I missed my dad’s hugs when he came home from work,” he recalls. “It was a different kind of bond, but strong enough that I still feel it today.”
  Azlan admits that he was the most pampered or sheltered among his siblings growing up. But he knows that the world his children are growing up in is “tougher”.
  That’s why, he explains, “I am raising them to be not just kind and compassionate, but strong and self-reliant.”
  For both Sharkawi and Azlan, presence is the foundation of trust. As Azlan puts it: “Children need someone they can talk to. Someone they know is really there.”
  And that’s what both fathers are striving for: friendship, ­openness and trust.
  For Sharkawi, that openness was nurtured through years of road trips and long photo walks with young Afiq. What began as a hobby gradually became a sort of ritual for the duo.
  Now, Afiq is just as passionate about photography as his father is. “It is where we connect,” Sharkawi shares.
  “We give each other feedback, share memories behind the photos, and that shared space has transformed our relationship. We are like friends now.”
  When they travel, Afiq opens up to him. “That’s when the important stuff comes out,” Sharkawi adds.
  Azlan and his twin sons enjoy learning about new cultures around the world. — AZLAN ANDI
  Meanwhile, Azlan says travelling with his now nine-year-old twin boys has done more than just bring them closer. “Seeing the world so young has made them more open-minded.”
  Experiencing different cultures and lifestyles has not only widened their perspectives in ways a classroom never could, but also encouraged them to step out of their comfort zones and try new things.
  Going to new places shows kids how to think on their feet and do things on their own, encouraging them to not be overly dependent, Azlan says. His children are now more confident in unfamiliar situations, quick to adjust when met with unexpected changes and eager to learn from their surroundings.
  “They ask questions. They see things. And they are curious just by being out there with me.”
  That’s exactly why Lanier is passionate about travelling with his children as well. For him, it’s about keeping their sense of curiosity alive, just like his father did for him. They didn’t travel much when he was young, but the few trips they did take left a lasting impact.
  It wasn’t about how many places they went, it was about the experience they shared.
  His father’s presence during those formative years has shaped not only how he sees the world, but also the kind of father he hopes to be today.
  Lanier wants to give his kids a chance to experience the world through travelling. Occasionally, he travels only with his eldest son, Gray. — EVAN LANIER 
  Lessons from the road 
  Mak says that once his children are outside the familiar setting of home, they often surprise him. “They show sides of themselves I don’t always get to see,” he reveals.
  During a recent trip to a personal development camp, Mak had the chance to witness this. “It was incredible watching them learn from older students, how they handled pressure, managed their emotions, balanced work and play, and supported one another,” he says, proudly.
  What he found especially meaningful was how naturally his boys fit in to different situations. “They were meeting strangers, learning cultural differences,” Mak says.
  The most precious gift we can give to our children as parents is time, Mak says. — RAY MAK
  One thing Azlan has noticed about his twins is that even though they look alike, they have very different personalities and interests. “Travelling has helped me discover this,” he says.
  It is ever important for parents to know their children, as it helps reduce misunderstandings and builds stronger, more respectful relationships. When kids feel that their parents genuinely care, it helps them feel valued and boosts their confidence, too.
  “I don’t just see them as my kids, I see them as their own people. Our bond is more than just parenting, it is about understanding each other,” Azlan shares.
  Forgetting camera gear, unexpected downpours and getting lost were the kinds of hiccups that could have derailed a photography trip. But for Sharkawi, these challenges became the very experiences that made his bond with Afiq stronger. They had to handle the situations together as a team.
  “I was surprised by how calm and resourceful Afiq was when under pressure,” he says.
  It is easy to think that teenagers might struggle in hard situations or that parents are the ones teaching all the lessons. But on the road, Sharkawi found out it was the opposite.
  “Instead of me teaching him, I learnt a lot from him.”
  These challenges showed qualities in Afiq that everyday life might not always bring out. He is also creative and observant, which helped him win photography contests both locally and internationally.
  One of the pictures Sharkawi took of a traditional keris maker, while travelling around Malaysia with his son. — Dr SHARKAWI CHE DIN
  One of Sharkawi’s proudest moments was in 2023 when Afiq won first prize in a contest called “Picture My Rights”, organised by Unicef in conjunction with World Children’s Day in Semporna, Sabah. His photo of a toddler sitting on a boat in the ocean captured the daily life of the Pala’uh people who are deeply connected to the sea.
  But that wasn’t all. The year before, Afiq also earned first place in the Philippines Youth Photo Competition.
  “Watching him work hard and stay positive allowed me to see a different side of him – one I might have missed if we hadn’t spent time together travelling.”
  Azlan says that travelling with young children also means being ready for anything, like knowing how to soothe them when things don’t go as planned. For example, getting detained by immigration in another country.
  During the height of Brexit tensions, Azlan and his then two-year-old twins found themselves being stuck overnight at a British immigration centre. Escorted by police, they were caught in a situation no parent ever wants to face, especially with toddlers in tow.
  The twins were too young to understand what was going on; the unfamiliar voices and chaos around frightened them. Instead of panicking, Azlan kept his children calm, reassuring them that everything would be fine.
  Perhaps, when they are old enough, they will share this story, as well as all their travel experiences with friends and fellow travellers.

上个月在偶然的机会下，采访了一名16岁的星星少年治源，哪怕是患有中度自闭症，他依旧积极地追寻自己的梦想，并在亲人及朋友们的协助下，勇于踏入昆虫世界。
采访过程中，完全感觉不出他是自闭症患者，他就像一般的青年一样活泼，大方地向民众展示自己所饲养的昆虫，且中英语切换自如，向民众介绍各类昆虫的习性。
ADVERTISEMENT
他就是其中一个成功突破交流障碍的例子，在母亲的支持下，勇敢踏出探索外界的第一步，挖掘出自己的兴趣，并积极向外界展现自我。
每每谈及母亲的付出，治源总是第一时间冲上去拥抱母亲，这与一般人羞于表达对父母的爱有所不同，他打从心底了解父母对他的付出，毫不吝啬地表达自己对父母的感激之情。
也许是兴趣使然，昆虫就像是一把钥匙一样，打开他的世界大门，让他结交到来自不同区域的朋友，共同推广环境保护的知识。
其实，国内有不少像治源一样的自闭症患者，他们或许症状不同、表达方式不同，但都非常需要获得社会各方的支持与鼓励。
自闭症患者普遍被称为“星星的孩子”，在与众不同的世界里独自闪耀，他们对于世界与周围环境都有着与众不同的见解，却因社交障碍，令他们无法更深入地了解人情世故与社会规则。
每个孩子都是独一无二的个体，自闭症孩子也不例外，他们拥有自己的个性、兴趣爱好，从中摸索出和社会沟通的桥梁。
然而，自闭症的两大核心症状包括社交障碍及刻板行为，却让他们偶尔会承受来自他人的误解，但其实在他们的内心深处，也渴望社交与社会建立联系。
自闭症的治疗往往需要在长期的康复训练与特殊教育的干预下持续进行，这是一段漫长的治疗过程，患者家庭需要面临来自社会、经济、心理、学校等多方面的压力，他们所承受的苦楚，恐怕一时半会也难以说尽。
与其他病症一样，及早发现、诊断、干预及治疗对于自闭症患者而言极为重要，但在我国要取得完整的自闭症人士数据很难，其中一个原因是诊断自闭症的专才非常少，再加上自闭症患者的外表与一般人无异，导致他们无法获得及时的诊断与治疗，逐步与社会脱节。
因此希望我国能加强对于自闭症的宣传、医疗和资金等投入，让人们更了解自闭症的症状，共同建设更包容与理解的外在环境，协助自闭症患者融入社会。
通过此次的采访，我深刻感受到自闭症患者就是社会中的一份子，我非常期待有更多自闭症患者勇于踏上追梦的路途，通过与社会各阶层人士的交流，逐步敞开心扉，感受世界的美好。

长巴业者协会
日前公开发文揭露，全国有数千辆长途巴士涉及“非法租赁准证”活动后，交通部长
陆兆福
在回应时却表示，既然巴士业者知道此事，就应主动举报。我们相信陆兆福这番话的原意，是希望相关业界甚至是相关人员，都能够动员起來，主动维护行业秩序的责任。但在仔细推敲之下，这番讲话却是暴露出了政府在履行监管职务上的疏漏与被动。
我们必须承认，任何社会要获得良好且平和的运作，人民和政府都有责任共同维护法治的监督力。然而，政府作为执法与监管的主体，拥有公权力和资源，在呼吁之余则不可把打击非法活动的相关责任交给人民或业者。尤其是像公共交通这样的行业，事关乘客安全及社会秩序，也只能是由政府牵头主动作为的。
针对此次长巴业者协会发文揭露，全国有数千辆长途巴士，涉及非法“租赁准证”活动，每月收费约500令吉的事件。其实这个动作本身就已经是一种实名和实质性的举报了，政府理应以此为线索，立即彻查，根除行业乱象。遗憾的是，陆兆福的反应却是要求业者针对这个现象主动举报。这样的回应是让人沮丧的，让人感觉彷佛政府是局外人，只能被动等待。
这样的态度无疑本末倒置。这就好比市民在社交媒体上传了一段车辆危险驾驶的视频，警方不立即展开调查，反而要求上传视频者主动到警局报案录口供后，才考虑行动。我们不禁要问，如果连主动介入调查，主动取证都不愿意做，那么这些政府部门的存在，又有什么作用和意义呢？
不可否认，公共交通行业长期积累的问题，源于制度、监管、行业自律等多方面。但每一起因非法营运引发的悲剧，都在提醒政府，行业乱象不容姑息，监管不能再宽松。鉴于责任之重大，政府岂可要求没有行政和执法权的业者或人民，一旦获得任何消息的就要主动举报，自身却坐等证据完整后才行动。其实在看到问题后，政府就应该立即展开调查，并部署执法才对。因此陆兆福要求业者主动举报的言论，不由让人怀疑政府在整顿公共交通行业的问题上，是否存在有心无力的困境。
但无论如何，公共交通“非法租赁准证”的行为，不仅是行业问题，更是公共安全问题。交通部对此责无旁贷，必须履行职责，用实际行动來向人民展现其监管能力。而另一方面，任何作为人民代议士并出任部长者，其职责就是代替人民监管部门运作，是绝对不可把这个监督举报的责任，交回给业者或人民的，因此举于理不通也。难道不接获举报，就无作为了吗？

（北海15日讯）在马来西亚，
前列腺癌
是男性中最常见的
癌症
之一，因此被称为“
隐形杀手
”，但也是高度可治疗的癌症，尤其在
早期发现
并治疗的情况下，
康复
率极高。
槟城双威医疗中心泌尿专科医生
李世沐
指出，前列腺癌是男性常见的恶性肿瘤，大多数的早期病例无明显症状，因此早期的检测对于患者获得更好的结果至关重要。
ADVERTISEMENT
他指出，马来西亚有些前列腺癌患者在确诊时已是晚期，癌细胞已扩散。尽管自我检查不适用，但可以通过前列腺特异性抗原测试（PSA）和直肠指检进行早期发现。
前列腺癌早期症状或不明显
因此，李世沐建议50岁以上的男性应每两到三年检查一次，若有家族病史，则建议从45岁开始筛查。
李世沐：“早期的检测对于前列腺癌患者获得更好的结果至关重要。”
他说，前列腺癌的早期症状可能不明显，随着病情发展，可能会出现排尿困难、尿频、尿急、排尿时有烧灼或疼痛感、尿中带血（血尿）或精液中带血等症状；高危人群包括高龄者、高脂肪饮食习惯者、肥胖者和有家族史者。
“因此，多做运动、避免高脂肪食品及不要被肥胖纠缠，将有力降低患上前列腺癌的风险。”
不过，他说，目前没有迹象表明前列腺癌呈现年轻化趋势。尽管确实存在一些年轻患者，但他们的病情往往发展迅速，显示出较为严重的状态。
李世沐指出，前列腺癌的治疗方法取决于癌症的位置、大小、阶段，以及患者的整体健康状况、生活质量和预期寿命。常见的治疗方法包括：
•如果前列腺癌造成的风险较低，可以选择主动监测作为治疗方法。•外科手术：根治性前列腺切除术，采用机器人辅助进行精确手术，以促进康复并减少并发症。•放射治疗：根据癌症的风险水平定制治疗方案，包括内部（近距离放射治疗）和外部放射治疗。•化疗：适用于晚期阶段，治疗效果及副作用管理不断改善。•激素疗法：旨在减少或停止睾酮的产生，尤其对晚期或转移性病例至关重要。
北马首家采用机器人辅助手术 槟双威医疗中心成患者选择
他指出，根治性前列腺切除术有3种方式：腹腔镜手术、机器人辅助根治性前列腺切除术（RARP）和传统开放手术，其中，机器人辅助微创手术最为精确安全，不仅有机会保留神经线，还能降低阳痿风险。
“如果患者身体状况良好，手术应是首选，尽管所有癌症都有复发风险，但如果在手术几年后复发，可以选择放疗。如果先进行放疗，后续再手术则相对困难。”
李世沐说，槟城双威医疗中心是北马首家采用机器人辅助达芬奇手术的医院，因此成为患者的选择；然而，进行此手术的患者必须具备足够的心脏和肺部健康状况，否则可能会面临后遗症。
李世沐展示经直肠超声（TRUS）的探头，它将插入病患的直肠进行疾病诊断；该探头发射频率较高，因此能够获取高分辨率的灰阶和彩色血流影像。
“由于机器人辅助是以微创手术方式进行，因此并发症更少、减少失血及更快的愈合时间。”
他说，至于前列腺癌的诊断过程和检查，则包括以下步骤:
•直肠指检 (DRE)，由医生评估前列腺大小、形状和质地的体检。•前列腺特异性抗原 (PSA) 测试：血液中 PSA 水平升高可能表明前列腺癌。•磁共振成像 (MRI)：提供前列腺的详细图像。•经直肠超声 (TRUS)：使用声波创建前列腺图像并指导活检程序。•MRI/超声融合活检：结合 MRI 和超声，在活检过程中精确定位癌组织。•前列腺正电子及电脑双融扫描（PSMA PET-CT）： 检验转移，确定癌症是否扩散。
每年11月为男性健康意识月
每年11月是男性健康意识月，旨在提高男性对健康问题的意识，关注男性的生理、心理及各方面的健康，特别是前列腺癌、睾丸癌及男性心理健康等问题。
李世沐说，男性往往是家庭的主要支柱，为家庭提供稳定的经济支持，因此男性肩头的重担可能对其心理健康产生严重影响，对男性来说，经济是最大的压力来源之一，可能导致焦虑、抑郁和其他心理健康问题。
“尤其是东方男性，通常较为含蓄，因此他们对癌症的恐惧更为明显；他们担心若自己罹患此病，家庭的负担将由谁来承担，因此难以接受这一现实。”

（北海15日讯）在马来西亚，前列腺癌是男性中最常见的癌症之一，因此被称为“隐形杀手”，但也是高度可治疗的癌症，尤其在早期发现并治疗的情况下，康复率极高。
槟城双威医疗中心泌尿专科医生李世沐指出，前列腺癌是男性常见的恶性肿瘤，大多数的早期病例无明显症状，因此早期的检测对于患者获得更好的结果至关重要。

ADVERTISEMENT

他指出，马来西亚有些前列腺癌患者在确诊时已是晚期，癌细胞已扩散。尽管自我检查不适用，但可以通过前列腺特异性抗原测试（PSA）和直肠指检进行早期发现。前列腺癌早期症状或不明显
因此，李世沐建议50岁以上的男性应每两到三年检查一次，若有家族病史，则建议从45岁开始筛查。
 李世沐：“早期的检测对于前列腺癌患者获得更好的结果至关重要。” 
他说，前列腺癌的早期症状可能不明显，随着病情发展，可能会出现排尿困难、尿频、尿急、排尿时有烧灼或疼痛感、尿中带血（血尿）或精液中带血等症状；高危人群包括高龄者、高脂肪饮食习惯者、肥胖者和有家族史者。

“因此，多做运动、避免高脂肪食品及不要被肥胖纠缠，将有力降低患上前列腺癌的风险。”


不过，他说，目前没有迹象表明前列腺癌呈现年轻化趋势。尽管确实存在一些年轻患者，但他们的病情往往发展迅速，显示出较为严重的状态。

李世沐指出，前列腺癌的治疗方法取决于癌症的位置、大小、阶段，以及患者的整体健康状况、生活质量和预期寿命。常见的治疗方法包括：

•如果前列腺癌造成的风险较低，可以选择主动监测作为治疗方法。
 •外科手术：根治性前列腺切除术，采用机器人辅助进行精确手术，以促进康复并减少并发症。
 •放射治疗：根据癌症的风险水平定制治疗方案，包括内部（近距离放射治疗）和外部放射治疗。
 •化疗：适用于晚期阶段，治疗效果及副作用管理不断改善。
 •激素疗法：旨在减少或停止睾酮的产生，尤其对晚期或转移性病例至关重要。
北马首家采用机器人辅助手术 槟双威医疗中心成患者选择
他指出，根治性前列腺切除术有3种方式：腹腔镜手术、机器人辅助根治性前列腺切除术（RARP）和传统开放手术，其中，机器人辅助微创手术最为精确安全，不仅有机会保留神经线，还能降低阳痿风险。
“如果患者身体状况良好，手术应是首选，尽管所有癌症都有复发风险，但如果在手术几年后复发，可以选择放疗。如果先进行放疗，后续再手术则相对困难。”
李世沐说，槟城双威医疗中心是北马首家采用机器人辅助达芬奇手术的医院，因此成为患者的选择；然而，进行此手术的患者必须具备足够的心脏和肺部健康状况，否则可能会面临后遗症。 李世沐展示经直肠超声（TRUS）的探头，它将插入病患的直肠进行疾病诊断；该探头发射频率较高，因此能够获取高分辨率的灰阶和彩色血流影像。 
“由于机器人辅助是以微创手术方式进行，因此并发症更少、减少失血及更快的愈合时间。”
他说，至于前列腺癌的诊断过程和检查，则包括以下步骤:
•直肠指检 (DRE)，由医生评估前列腺大小、形状和质地的体检。
 •前列腺特异性抗原 (PSA) 测试：血液中 PSA 水平升高可能表明前列腺癌。
 •磁共振成像 (MRI)：提供前列腺的详细图像。
 •经直肠超声 (TRUS)：使用声波创建前列腺图像并指导活检程序。
 •MRI/超声融合活检：结合 MRI 和超声，在活检过程中精确定位癌组织。
 •前列腺正电子及电脑双融扫描（PSMA PET-CT）： 检验转移，确定癌症是否扩散。每年11月为男性健康意识月
每年11月是男性健康意识月，旨在提高男性对健康问题的意识，关注男性的生理、心理及各方面的健康，特别是前列腺癌、睾丸癌及男性心理健康等问题。
李世沐说，男性往往是家庭的主要支柱，为家庭提供稳定的经济支持，因此男性肩头的重担可能对其心理健康产生严重影响，对男性来说，经济是最大的压力来源之一，可能导致焦虑、抑郁和其他心理健康问题。
“尤其是东方男性，通常较为含蓄，因此他们对癌症的恐惧更为明显；他们担心若自己罹患此病，家庭的负担将由谁来承担，因此难以接受这一现实。”
李世沐强调，然而预防胜于治疗，如果不能预防，就要早期诊断及早期干预，以取得最佳的结果。
他说，男性往往在健康检查方面最常忽视心脏健康、前列腺健康、心理健康和性健康。
总体来说，男性健康意识月通过提升认识和教育，旨在改善男性的健康状况，进而推动社会对男性健康问题的重视。

男骑士添油完毕后，男子只跟他收取1令吉油钱，让他吓到。（视频截图）
他热情地接待每位到其油泵位置添油的摩托骑士，亲自帮他们的摩托车添油，还给他们送上惊喜。
添油完毕后，该男子询问每位骑士有没有1令吉，接着对他们说，油钱只需1令吉，即便是添油满缸的骑士，也是一律只收1令吉。
“只收RM1就好，不管加了多少油。”
据悉，这起好人好事是在位于霹雳甘文丁Taman Lela一个油站处发生。
视频中可见，骑士们纷纷露出惊讶的表情，以为男子在开玩笑，最后确认是真的后，纷纷向男子道谢。
此外，视频中另一个亮点是，一名大叔骑着摩托车来到油泵添油时，跟这名行善的男子说他要为其摩托车添RON97汽油，男子也是照样跟他收取1令吉的油费。
每位骑士添油完毕离开时，该男子还贴心地提醒他们小心驾驶。
许多网民留言称赞男子的善心，有人还趁机询问男子，何时会给轿车司机这样的好康。

PETALING JAYA: Skuad Speedy Tigers berwaspada dengan ancaman pukulan sudut penalti Pakistan dalam perlawanan pembukaan Kumpulan B Piala Negara-Negara Persekutuan Hoki Antarabangsa (FIH) di Stadium Hoki Nasional Bukit Jalil, hari ini.
  Kapten negara, Muhammad Marhan Mohd Jalil berkata, Pakistan mempunyai pakar pukulan sudut penalti Pakistan, Sufyan Khan yang boleh mengundang padah kepada skuad negara jika tidak diberikan perhatian sewajarnya.
  Bagaimanapun kata Marhan, tumpuan tidak boleh diberikan kepada Sufyan semata-mata kerana ramai lagi pemain Paskitan yang boleh menghadirkan ancaman kepada skuad negara jika mereka diberikan ruang dalam gelanggang.
  “Kami tahu dia pakar pukulan sudut penalti. Tapi kami juga kaji cara nak hentikan dia dan berlatih untuk pelari pertama bagi menutup kawasan penalti. Bagi saya, setiap pasukan ada pakar tersendiri,” kata Marhan dalam sidang akhbar pra perlawanan, semalam.
  Selain Pakistan, Malaysia turut diundi bersama New Zealand dan Jepun dalam Kumpulan B, manakala Kumpulan A dibarisi Korea Selatan, Perancis, Afrika Selatan dan Wales.
  Menurut Marhan, bermain di laman sendiri tidak menjanjikan kelebihan, sebaliknya memberi tekanan tersendiri buat para pemain untuk meraih keputusan positif.
  “Bagi saya, setiap perlawanan ada tekanannya, terutamanya bila berada di atas padang. Saya rasa lebih tertekan kerana kami nak beri yang terbaik dan capai keputusan terbaik.
  “Perlawanan pertama ini sangat penting bagi saya sebab kita perlukan kemenangan untuk naikkan semangat pemain lain supaya laluan ke separuh akhir lebih mudah. Pada masa sama, kami perlu lebih berdisiplin di atas padang dari minit pertama hingga akhir,” katanya.
  Dalam pada itu, ketua jurulatih negara, Sarjit Singh berkata, perlawanan pertama pastinya mencabar buat mana-mana-mana pasukan, namun berdasarkan semangat pemain beliau yakin Malaysia akan meraih keputusan positif dalam aksi berdepan Pakistan.
  “Semangat pasukan dalam keadaan baik. Kita dah bersedia dengan baik untuk kejohanan ini. Walaupun tewas 0-2 dalam perlawanan persahabatan menentang Wales sebelum ini, pemain mencipta banyak peluang dan menunjukkan permainan berani.
  “Kalau kita dapat sesuaikan diri dengan cepat, ia akan beri kelebihan kepada kita. Tapi kalau ambil masa lama nak sesuaikan diri, kita akan terpaksa kejar permainan seperti menentang Wales (kelmarin),” katanya.-UTUSAN

  PETALING JAYA: Pakistan are bracing for a stern test as they kick off their Nations Cup campaign against hosts Malaysia, a side they have grown increasingly familiar with over the past year.
  While historically dominant in this fixture, the South Asians are wary of the challenge that awaits them at the National Hockey Stadium in Bukit Jalil today, with coach Tahir Zaman (pic) acknowledging the evolution of the Malaysian side.
  
------------------------------

  PETALING JAYA: There’s no room for fear or hesitation as Malaysia prepare to face Pakistan in their opening match of the 2025 Nations Cup at 8pm today.
  National stalwarts Marhan Jalil and Fitri Saari have thrown down the gauntlet, calling on the Speedy Tigers’ young hockey players to rise to the occasion and show their worth, especially on home turf at the National Hockey Stadium in Bukit Jalil.

千百年来，人们从一个地方迁徙到另一个地方是一种自然现象：纵观历史，由于政治、经济、社会以及越来越多的环境原因，人们被鼓励或被迫迁徙。

今天，我们看到美国对移民问题持不同观点的派系之间发生了暴力抗议活动——表面上看是这样，因为许多人推断，有人故意煽动暴力，为进一步的独裁统治寻找理由，同时分散人们对美国国内其他政治事件的注意力。
与此同时，在巴勒斯坦，暴力冲突导致流离失所的事件屡见不鲜，外国援助受到严格管制。被以色列军队拦截的玛德琳号救援船本身就遇到并拯救了几名苏丹战争难民，他们逃离了祖国的暴力和迫害，却在另一个国家遭到进一步的拘留和酷刑。这一连串的苦难提醒我们，流离失所往往是一种长期的、反复发生的创伤。
但是，在马来西亚，我们应该如何纪念
世界难民日
呢？我们不是1951年关于难民地位的公约的签署国，而一致性也不是我们的强项。
在最坏的情况下，马来西亚政客将难民和移民问题作为吸引国内政治支持的政治筹码，而不改变任何政策。不幸的是，这些言论会给人留下政府偏袒某些族群的错误印象，从而加剧仇外心理。因此，近年来我们甚至在TikTok上看到了罗兴亚男子在清真寺中遭到殴打的视频。
有时，在人道主义者或富有同情心的部长持续施压的情况下，当局会对采取镇压措施睁一只眼闭一只眼，以便家庭得以生存，养家糊口的人可以在灰色经济中工作。一个众所周知的更加具体的例子就是，联合国难民署与马来西亚政府合作，为1970年代和80年代的
越南
船民提供庇护所（我曾见过其中一些人，他们至今仍对马来西亚拯救了他们的生命表示感激）。
在最好的情况下，政策得到了实际执行，投入资源，就像1990年代南斯拉夫战争的受害者一样，造就了在马来西亚接受教育的一代波斯尼亚决策者、专业人员和企业家，他们继续在经济、学术甚至美食方面为双边关系做出贡献。
但是，承认难民问题将有望永久性地改善决策。马来西亚公民社会的韧性确保了难民问题将始终被提上议事日程，而社交媒体则成为了维持关注的重要平台。值得注意的是，难民政策跨政党国会小组的成立意味着倡导者、学者、从业者和政策制定者之间有了沟通的渠道。由此产生的基于数据和共同人道主义关怀的跨政党合作非常令人鼓舞。
这反过来又赋予了与该社区合作的其他人信心。
现在有几所学校公开招收难民儿童。民主及经济事务研究所（IDEAS）国际学校就是其中之一，我很高兴最近在我们学校的毕业典礼上与合唱团一起用钢琴演奏了《最伟大的爱》。大马家长愿意把他们的孩子送到我们学校——让他们的孩子和难民孩子坐在同一间教室里——这也标志着我们的态度发生了重大转变。
除了教育外，尊严还意味着医疗保健和工作权。民主及经济事务研究所（IDEAS）关于难民的冠病报告中指出，这三大支柱对于防止长期创伤和社会排斥至关重要。2019年，我们估算了为难民提供就业权利的经济效益：据估计，为所有难民提供正规就业的机会，每年可为国内生产总值带来30亿令吉的额外收入，以及5000万令吉的额外税收。此外，据估计，到2040年，为难民学生提供平等的受教育机会，每年将为国内生产总值带来超过65亿令吉的收入，并带来2亿5000万令吉的税收。IDEAS正在努力更新这些估算，但当然还有更难以量化的同等或更高价值的人类和社会效益。
与此同时，IDEAS还与马来西亚
缅甸
咨询小组合作举办圆桌会议，探讨联邦制、妇女权益和选举等主题。这些活动增进了各利益相关方之间的了解和合作，共同应对这场多层面的危机。
事实上，汇集从一线医疗服务援助者、难民权利倡导者到数字内容监管者的各种声音至关重要，因为每个人都在这个维护尊严的生态系统中扮演着重要角色。通过这种方式，我们可以共同探讨医疗保健、难民权利、政策和数字内容管理之间的交集。
支持难民企业家，如Thimble Collective、缅甸钦族组织Mang Tha和罗兴亚妇女发展网络，是增强该社区能力的另一种方式。他们不仅仅是援助的被动接受者，也是自身权利的创造者。

他表示，女婴遗体已送往UiTM医院进行解剖，以确认死因；警方将此案暂列为猝死案，直到解剖报告结果出炉为止。
“警方事后已向涉案的保姆录供。”
他呼吁民众切勿对此案作出任何揣测，同时促知情者拨打绍佳娜乌达玛警局热线电话（03-6038 2222），或联系查案官莫哈末艾扎警长（013-486 1194），以提供相关线索。
较早前，社交媒体流传一张死者的照片，相信是死者母亲的女子在Instagram限时动态发布爱女的照片，对爱女喊话“我在天堂的孩子，你安详吧。妈咪会很想你，感谢你过去与妈咪和爸爸在一起的时光。我爱你。”

MUKADIMAH 
  WALAUPUN pekeliling pengharaman bot pukat tunda di Zon B sepatutnya dikuatkuasakan sejak 2016, pelaksanaannya terus tertangguh sehingga kini.
  Penangguhan itu membuktikan kurangnya kesungguhan pihak berwajib dalam melindungi hak dan keselamatan nelayan pantai. Malah, undang-undang seperti Akta Perikanan 1985 yang membolehkan rampasan lesen dan bot juga dikatakan tidak dikuatkuasakan secara konsisten.
  PUTRAJAYA: Kira-kira 102,746 nelayan pantai yang memiliki 48,440 sampan dan bot kecil berdepan risiko ancaman nyawa setiap hari, berikutan kes pencerobohan bot pukat tunda terus berlaku tanpa ada tindakan penyelesaian konkrit.
  Kejadian di Selangor bulan lalu menjadi bukti terbaharu apabila sampan nelayan dirempuh bot pukat tunda ketika menangkap ikan kira-kira 0.3 batu nautika di utara Pulau Klang menyebabkan seorang daripada mangsa maut manakala dua lagi terselamat.
  Mengikut peraturan, bot pukat tunda tidak boleh memasuki Zon A (kawasan kurang lima batu nautika dari pesisir pantai) termasuk bot nelayan dari negeri lain juga tidak boleh menceroboh sempadan negeri masing-masing.
  Hal ini boleh mengakibatkan kepupusan ikan-ikan kecil dan merosakkan sumber dasar laut, sekali gus memusnahkan ekosistem dan kehidupan marin, malah mengancam nyawa dan kehidupan nelayan pantai.
  Berdasarkan rekod Jabatan Perikanan, hasil tangkapan laut nelayan pantai semakin berkurangan iaitu sebanyak 1.10 juta tan metrik dengan nilai RM10.271 juta pada 2023 berbanding 1.15 juta tan metrik dengan nilai RM10.274 juta pada 2022.
  Menurut Timbalan Pengerusi Persatuan Pendidikan dan Kebajikan Jaringan Nelayan Pantai Malaysia (Jaring), Mohd. Faizal Mohd. Zabri, kerajaan sepatutnya mengharamkan bot pukat tunda daripada memasuki kawasan yang digazetkan di Zon B supaya ia tidak terlajak ke perairan Zon A yang hanya dikhususkan kepada nelayan pantai.
  Pekeliling untuk menghapuskan bot pukat tunda di Zon B sepatutnya dikuatkuasakan pada 2016, namun ditangguhkan sehingga hari ini tanpa satu dasar yang jelas.
  “Pelaksanaan pekeliling ini kemudian ditangguhkan lagi pada 2020 dan seterusnya dicadang untuk dilaksanakan pada 2024.
  “Namun, masih tetap tidak dilaksanakan dan ditangguhkan pula sehingga 2030. Ia sepatutnya tidak boleh lagi ditangguhkan dan perlu dilaksanakan segera kerana meletakkan risiko nyawa nelayan terus dalam bahaya,” katanya kepada Mingguan Malaysia.
  Beliau yang juga nelayan Teluk Bahang, Pulau Pinang berkata, kerajaan perlu berlaku adil kepada golongan nelayan pantai memandangkan mereka bergantung kepada hasil laut di kawasan Zon A kerana keadaan bot kecil tidak mampu bergerak jauh.
  Sedangkan, bot pukat tunda se­wenang-wenangnya boleh men­ceroboh zon nelayan pantai dan mengaut hasil laut sehingga menjejaskan pendapatan mereka.
  “Kita bukan nak tutup periuk nasi sesiapa, tetapi kegiatan pencerobohan ini semakin berleluasa seolah-olah tidak ada penguatkuasaan dilakukan atau pihak berkuasa hanya menutup mata bagi kesalahan yang dilakukan.
  “Di kawasan Teluk Bahang kerap kali bot pukat tunda dari Kedah ceroboh perairan Pulau Pinang. Di kawasan Pelabuhan Klang tempat pelabuhan perkapalan pun mereka berani beroperasi. Sampai bila keadaan ini akan terus dibiarkan,” katanya.
  Pada masa sama, pihak berkuasa terutama Jabatan Perikanan perlu melakukan siasatan atas setiap aduan termasuk Agensi Penguatkuasaan Maritim Malaysia dengan mengambil tindakan mengikut undang-undang ditetapkan.
  Ujarnya, sekalipun ada tangkapan dibuat, ada antara bot pukat tunda kembali beroperasi walaupun tidak cukup tempoh sitaan.
  Mengikut Akta Perikanan 1985, jika bot yang menceroboh zon didapati bersalah melebihi tiga kali kesalahan, bot dan lesen mereka akan dirampas.
  “Tetapi ia hanya sekadar undang-undang yang tidak pernah dilaksanakan. Kalau ikut pekeliling, bot yang menceroboh zon untuk pertama kali dan kedua tidak boleh dipindah milik tetapi bot-bot tersebut masih boleh dipindah milik dan semua ke­salahan lampau dihapuskan.
  “Bot-bot pukat tunda yang ceroboh zon patut disita, pemilik lesen disenarai hitam tidak dibenarkan membeli bot baharu. Pihak kami telah membawa isu ini kepada Suruhanjaya Integriti Agensi Penguatkuasaan (EAIC),” katanya.
  ANCAM KESELAMATAN, REZEKI NELAYAN PANTAI 
  Tinjauan Mingguan Malaysia di Sabak Bernam, Selangor mendapati, kegiatan bot pukat tunda yang menceroboh zon penangkapan ikan menyebabkan sampan nelayan berisiko dilanggar, malah hasil tangkapan mereka tidak menentu.
  Keadaan itu timbul apabila bot pukat tunda yang kebiasaannya dikendalikan warga asing memasuki Zon A yang berada kurang lima batu nautika dari perairan pantai seperti di Pantai Batu 23, Sungai Nibong, Sekinchan.
  Ketiadaan tindakan sita menyebabkan mereka semakin berani menceroboh dan turut menyebabkan kerosakan ekosistem laut.
  Ahli Jawatankuasa Jaring, Norhakim Mohamad Yasin berkata, peraturan menetapkan bot Kelas B dan B1 hanya dibenarkan menangkap ikan di kawasan antara lima hingga 15 batu nautika.
  Katanya, masih ada pihak di Zon B enggan mematuhinya dengan melakukan pencerobohan sama ada pada waktu petang atau malam.
  “Keadaan itu jelas membahayakan keselamatan nelayan pantai sehingga ada daripada kami nyaris maut selepas sampan dilanggar bot sehingga terbalik di perairan Sungai Nipah bulan lalu.
  “Insiden turut menimpa saya pada awal Disember lalu apabila sampan dinaiki nyaris dilanggar ketika menangkap ikan di Zon A pada sebelah malam. Mujur saya sempat menyalakan lampu dan disedari bot yang menceroboh,” katanya.
  20 TAHUN KES PENCEROBOHAN BERLAKU 
  Di Klang, Selangor, bukan sahaja hasil laut semakin berkurangan, kira-kira 170 nelayan pantai yang berpusat di Pangkalan Nelayan Sementa mendakwa, kegiatan sedemikian telah berlaku lebih 20 tahun lalu oleh mereka yang menggunakan bot Kelas A, B dan C.
  Menurut Ketua Pangkalan Nelayan Sementa, Raja Nasarudin Raja Ariffin, 68, mereka yang menggunakan pukat tunda lazimnya beroperasi pada waktu malam bagi mengelak dikesan pihak berkuasa.
  “Nelayan ini turut menutup nombor pendaftaran bot mereka menggunakan guni serta tidak membuka lampu. Jadi, ini menyukarkan kami untuk mengambil gambar bot mereka, sekiranya mereka menceroboh kawasan tangkapan kami.
  “Mereka yang menggunakan tiga kelas bot ini, kawasan yang sepatutnya mereka boleh tangkap bermula dari lapan batu nautika dari kawasan pesisir pantai,” katanya.
  Kata Raja Nasarudin, baru-baru ini dua nelayan di pangkalannya terkorban dengan kes terbaharu berlaku bulan lalu.
  Ujarnya, sudah beberapa kali pihaknya cuba bersemuka dengan kelompok penceroboh, namun mereka enggan malah cuba bertindak melanggar bot nelayan tempatan.
  “Memang sangat mengecewakan. Kami sudah buat beratus kali laporan berhubung tindakan mereka kepada pihak berkuasa, namun tiada satu tindakan tegas pun yang diambil,” katanya.
  Ditanya mengenai hasil tangkapan, ujar Raja Nasarudin, hasil tangkapan merosot lebih 50 peratus sejak beberapa tahun lalu.
  “Kami ini bukan orang senang, ibarat kais pagi makan pagi, kais petang makan petang. Mereka ini sudah bermaharajalela sejak puluhan tahun lagi,” katanya.
  WARGA ASING ANCAM NELAYAN PANTAI BAGAN DATUK 
  Nelayan pantai di perairan Bagan Datuk, Perak pula mengeluh dengan kehadiran warga asing yang diupah sebagai tekong dan awak-awak bot pukat tunda.
  Wakil nelayan, Sharizal Sarwan, 42, berkata, kehadiran mereka yang sebahagian besarnya warga Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar dan Vietnam langsung tidak mempedulikan hak yang digazetkan untuk nelayan pantai tempatan.
  “Saya sendiri pernah pergi ke laut tetapi balik tangan kosong. Kalau dapat RM50, tolak kos minyak RM30 dan baki RM20, apa hendak diberi makan kepada anak dan isteri? Sebelum ini kami boleh meraih RM200 hingga RM300 setiap kali ke laut,” katanya.
  Katanya, tidak diketahui sama ada warga asing itu mempunyai permit sah atau tidak.
  “Kalau dahulu mereka hanya menangkap ikan pada waktu siang tetapi sekarang kalau cuaca baik, malam hari pun mereka masih menangkap ikan,” katanya.
  Seorang lagi nelayan, Jamil Mahusin, 57, berkata, kehadiran bot pukat tunda yang dikendalikan warga asing semakin bertambah daripada 20 bot beberapa tahun lalu meningkat hingga 60 bot.
  “Mereka menangkap ikan hingga kawasan projek tukun tiruan dan mengganggu pembiakan ikan. Perkara ini amat dikesali dan memperlihatkan betapa mereka bebas melakukan apa sahaja,” katanya. – UTUSAN

MENTERI Pengangkutan, Anthony Loke secara terbuka mengatakan Sistem Kesalahan Jalan Raya (Kejara) yang dilaksanakan sejak 2017 gagal dan tidak efektif sama sekali bagi menilai dan mendisiplinkan pemandu. Kita sebagai pemandu pun tidak tahu sistem itu wujud dan langsung tidak tahu bagaimana ia digunakan untuk mendisiplinkan pemandu. Maknanya kadang-kadang peraturan yang dibuat ini hanya syok sendiri dan hangat-hangat tahi ayam. Apabila ditanya, maka para sang penguasa pun akan berkata, ya… kita ada macam-macam sistem untuk kawal, hukum dan disiplinkan pemandu. Tetapi berapa ramai yang sudah dikenakan hukuman berasaskan mata demerit Kejara…

GEORGE TOWN: As someone who has been selling mee jawa for the past 50 years, Lim Lean Hoe has a trick of the trade.
  “Cook the mee with a sincere heart,” he said.
  And that explains why he is still serving mee jawa at just RM2.50 a plate despite the surging cost of ingredients.
  The portion remains the same and so are the ingredients.
  “I don’t have the heart to make it pricey,” said Lim, 70.
  He recalled the early days in the 1970s when he started his trade.
  “It was 80sen those days before I increased it to RM1 per plate. And I have kept it at RM2.50 since.”
  Lim said he wanted his customers to have an affordable meal.
  “Even though the cost of ingredients, like noodles and other items have gone up, I can still make a profit. It’s just that it is a smaller profit now,” he said.
  The grandfather of five said the money is enough for him and his wife.
  However, he conceded that he had stopped putting prawns in the noodle dish for the past 10 years.
  “I decided to stop doing it because prawns are just too expensive,” he said.
  Lim’s mee jawa is a simple meal with chicken slices, hard-boiled egg, tofu, bean sprouts and a sprinkle of fresh lettuce.
  He said he has maintained the same recipe that he learned from his uncle.
  Lim, who started his business at Penang Road, now operates from a stall located in a restaurant in Air Itam. It is open every day from 7am until 1.30pm.
  He only closes during the Chinese New Year celebrations.
  The restaurant is a popular breakfast spot in the high-density working-class area.
  “I feel happy every time I see people coming here for a plate of my mee jawa,” he said.
  And his customers are delighted, too.
  “The portion has always been consistent. One of the best in town,” said pensioner Simon Khor, 65.
  Khor, who is a regular at Lim’s stall, said the noodles are not only affordable but also tasty.
  He said Lim will not even charge extra when customers asked for more noodles.
  “He always says it’s more important that people leave full and happy than to make extra profit,” he added.
  Another regular, Lee Hean Seng, 57, said he has been eating Lim’s mee jawa once a week for the past 15 years.
  “The price is ideal for people like us who do not earn a lot. And the portion is big, too,” said the security guard.
  “It’s cheap and good,” he added.

MUAR: Amber Chuah’s sojourn to a beach near Muar to seek some solace last December upended her life completely.
  Instead of getting that dose of inner peace she was looking for, she was stunned to see an expanse of litter on the coastline around Tanjung Emas.
  The 29-year-old freelancer said she was feeling emotionally drained and thought a trip to the beach would clear her mind and recharge her.
  “Instead of peace, I was met with plastic bags floating in the waves and trash lodged in the sand.
  “The sight was overwhelming, so I decided to return the next day with rubbish bags and a pair of tongs to pick up the trash,” she said, narrating how her one-woman crusade gave birth to a beach clean-up movement in the area.
  Chuah said that picking up litter gave her a sense of gratification, and it eventually turned into a routine for her.
  About a month later, an elderly woman spotted Chuah doing her usual clean-up and offered her a pair of gloves for protection.
  “To my surprise, the woman also put on gloves and joined me in picking up trash along the coastline.
  “That moment really touched me and made me realise I was not alone, and maybe others would want to help, too,” she said.
  The encounter gave Chuah the courage to start the Malaysia Environment Pioneer group to rally more volunteers for a common purpose.
  The group had since organised several beach-cleaning events in Muar and Desaru, attracting over 110 volunteers aged from three to 70.
  Together, they have collected more than 550kg of waste, of which some 80% were single-use plastics.
  “Besides that, we also unearthed odd items such as dentures, children’s schoolbags, kites, a police hat, condoms and even a washed-up mattress.
  “The mattress was an eye-opener for many of us – it was a sad reminder of how much people still treat the ocean like a dumping ground,” she said, noting that most of the trash collected was not biodegradable and posed a long-term threat to the marine ecosystem.
  Chuah is thankful for the support of the Muar Municipal Council and Pengerang Municipal Council as her group managed to obtain year-round permission to carry out their activities at selected beaches.
  “Both local authorities have also been actively supportive and encouraging, deploying staff and rubbish collection trucks to assist during clean-up days.
  “My core team and I are working towards registering the group as an official non-governmental organisation with the Registrar of Societies to scale up operations beyond Johor,” she added.
  Chuah said they are also planning upcoming events, including a beach cleaning in Desaru Beach at 8am on July 19, and an internal clean-up session in collaboration with a major hypermarket chain as part of its corporate social responsibility initiative.
  She hopes that her story will inspire more Malaysians to take personal responsibility for the environment, even if in small ways.
  Chuah also believes that children’s involvement is crucial in shaping future environmentally-conscious individuals.
  “When kids come along and see firsthand what pollution looks like, it plants a seed. Some of them even start asking their parents not to use plastic straws or to bring their own bags when shopping – that is where change starts.”

GOPENG: Perak is finalising two key initiatives to tackle the rising number of stray animals, namely the introduction of microchips for dog licensing, as well as feeder mapping to manage the location of animal feeders.
  State housing and local government committee chairman Sandrea Ng said the first initiative is a proposal to make it compulsory for dogs to be microchipped to increase traceability of pet ownership. 
  “This move aims to introduce a more transparent and responsible pet ownership system. With microchipping, authorities will be able to trace the owner’s identity, and the animal’s vaccination records and neutering history.
  “This would allow dogs to be identified and reunited with owners in the event of disturbances, loss or complaints. It is also expected to reduce cases of owners abandoning their dogs, an act which burdens the community and state resources,” she said after launching the Perak Pawsitive Initiative for the Teja constituency here yesterday.
  Ng said the feeder mapping system aims to recognise and regulate those who voluntarily feed stray animals. 
  She said many feeders have been operating independently for years, often without proper coordination. 
  “In some cases, feeding areas have led to public complaints due to disturbances, hygiene issues or increasing numbers of strays. 
  “Through this initiative, feeders will be encouraged to register with the cooperation of local authorities and animal welfare NGOs. 
  “This will help ensure that feeding areas are monitored, dogs in those zones are neutered and cleanliness is maintained,” she said, adding that a basic digital platform will be developed to map feeding hotspots, allowing complaints to be addressed more effectively, aid to be channelled accurately and intervention strategies to be planned in advance.
  “This is not just a technical effort but also an acknowledgement of the community’s role and effort as part of the state’s goal of transforming into a smart city,” she said. 
  Ng added that the government is studying aspects such as cost implications, record management systems and enforcement methods.
  “We will finalise it by the end of the year. The priority is to deve­lop a fair, efficient and enforceable framework for long-term use,” she said.

士拉央弘德龙狮体育会使出11个难度动作，一举压下原本得分最高的美湖体育及文化协会夺冠。
士拉央弘德龙狮体育会的比赛主题为“雄狮采灵芝献主”，在他们出场前，是刚于上周完成槟州武术龙狮锦标赛“高桩南狮”四连霸的槟城美湖体育及文化协会。
全国高桩舞狮争霸赛2队伍突破9分
排在第12队出场的美湖体育及文化协会的队员，以高超技艺获得9.10高分，也是整晚比赛中第一支突破9分的队伍；士拉央弘德龙狮体育会出场后，表现技高一筹，最终以11个难度动作的2分优势，使得总分比美湖体育及文化协会多出0.08分的优势锁定胜局。
无论如何，两支队伍的表现旗鼓相当，也是全场没有扣分的队伍。
掉桩是高桩舞狮中常见的失误，尽管队员知道无望获胜，仍然坚持完成比赛，体育精神令人钦佩。
至于最后出场的培德龙狮体育会队员在鼓乐响起后精神抖擞，在桩上的动作难度也相当高，可惜比赛过程中两度掉桩，负责狮头的队员还不小心摔伤右手腕，即使两人以侧空翻下桩结束表演，但他们没有完成竞赛套路，以致失去获奖资格。
彭亨关丹建造行武术醒狮圈则以“雄狮智取悬崖青”获得季军，前三甲得主分别赢走5000令吉、3000令吉和2000令吉的奖金，优秀奖得主的奖金是888令吉。

TOKYO, June 15 — Nippon Steel yesterday touted a “historic partnership” with US Steel after President Donald Trump approved a multi-billion-dollar merger.
  But the Japanese giant faces numerous headwinds going forward.
  Here are some of the challenges facing the company, from trade tariffs to lacklustre global demand:
  US conditions  
  Nippon Steel and US Steel said they had “entered into a National Security Agreement” with the US government, which “provides that approximately US$11 billion (RM46.7 billion) in new investments will be made by 2028”.
  Former president Joe Biden had blocked the deal on national security grounds shortly before leaving the White House.
  Other conditions include a so-called “golden share” for the US government, giving it more control over the company, as well as non-specified “commitments” related to domestic production and trade.
  “All necessary regulatory approvals for the partnership have now been received, and the partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,” the companies said in a statement.
  Financial burden  
  Ratings agency S&P last month said that the “huge financial burden” of the deal could cause it to downgrade Nippon Steel more severely than planned.
  Bloomberg Intelligence’s Michelle Leung also warned in May that the US$14.9 billion merger would “significantly increase the Japanese firm’s debt burden from the current US$16.7 billion”.
  “A deal might help Nippon Steel diversify beyond its sluggish domestic market, though it would need to invest heavily to help repair the aging assets of US Steel,” she said.
  Some shareholders have expressed alarm, with activist investor 3D Investment Partners calling for opposition to the reappointment of Nippon Steel executives at an upcoming annual general meeting.
  “This level of capital outlay” risks an “irreversible impairment of corporate value”, it warned.
  Tariff threat  
  “Weak domestic and overseas demand for steel products and the indirect effects of US tariffs imposed on steel” will likely hit Nippon Steel’s earnings, S&P said.
  The company has warned that global steel demand is “in an unprecedented state of crisis” — a trend fuelled by sluggish economic activity, oversupply in the market and fewer public infrastructure projects.
  It will also need to grapple with Trump’s tariff offensive — with levies on steel and aluminium imports recently doubled to 50 per cent.
  In Japan, the ageing population is weighing on demand for steel, but exporting is also becoming more challenging as other countries boost local production.
  To address this, Nippon Steel has strengthened its international presence by acquiring Indian and Thai steelmakers.
  The US Steel merger is part of this strategy: it will allow Nippon Steel to achieve global crude steel production capacity of 86 million tonnes a year, up from 66 million currently, it says.
  Chinese overproduction  
  Global steel demand is growing at a pace of less than one per cent per year, which is mismatched with the anticipated 6.7 per cent jump in production capacities by 2027, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
  That will likely cause a price drop, threatening many steelmakers.
  Much of this surplus is subsidised by China, the world’s largest steel producer, in what the OECD characterises as a “policy distortion”.
  Steel exports from China have more than doubled since 2020, prompting regions including the European Union to launch anti-dumping investigations.
  Chinese demand for steel is slowing and the country’s “exporting spree... is aimed at driving up its GDP”, Ryunosuke Shibata of SBI Securities told AFP.
  “A vast amount of steel is flowing into Asia at prices that are barely profitable,” sparking a “wave of price competition”, Shibata said.
  Costly decarbonisation  
  Japan has pledged to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, as governments worldwide work to curb their emissions.
  As part of its own efforts to produce less planet-warming carbon dioxide, Nippon Steel has announced a US$6 billion plan to build, modify or restart three less polluting “electric arc” furnaces at different sites.
  Around a third of the funding will come from the government.
  But the investment “could lead to mounting financial costs” as production from the facilities will not start before the 2029 financial year, Leung said. — AFP

NEW YORK
:
The partnership between US Steel and Nippon Steel has reached a new phase, with an agreement on US national security guarantees, in addition to the so-called “golden share” advantage obtained by president Donald Trump’s administration.
On Friday evening, Trump signed an executive order approving the partnership, bringing an end to the long-running saga over foreign ownership of a key national asset which began in December 2023, when US Steel and Nippon Steel announced plans for a US$14.9 billion merger.
Nippon’s acquisition of US Steel was held up by former president Joe Biden, who blocked it in his last weeks in the White House on national security grounds.
Trump initially opposed Nippon Steel’s takeover plan, calling for US Steel to remain domestically owned, but he threw his support behind a “partnership” in May.
“US Steel will REMAIN in America, and keep its Headquarters in the Great City of Pittsburgh,” the US president said in a Truth Social post.
In a joint statement, US Steel and Nippon Steel said Trump “has approved the companies’ historic partnership that will unleash unprecedented investments in steelmaking in the US, protecting and creating more than 100,000 jobs”.
“In addition to president Trump’s executive order approving the partnership, the companies have entered into a national security agreement (NSA) with the US government,” they said, which calls for approximately US$11 billion in new investments to be made by 2028.
Trump’s executive order did not provide details about the NSA, but he reserved the authority to issue further orders “as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect the national security of the US”.
Friday’s announcement follows a review of the deal by the government’s committee on foreign investment in the US (CFIUS), which is tasked with analysing the national security implications of foreign takeovers of US companies.
Yesterday, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick insisted on the need for the “perpetual golden share”, which gives the US government the right to block any action it so chooses.
Lutnick did not elaborate on the precise value of the share, saying only that it had “powerful terms that directly benefit and protect America, Pennsylvania, the great steelworkers of US Steel, and US manufacturers”.
He gave a list of examples of actions that the US government would have to approve, including any relocation of US Steel headquarters, moving the company outside the US, changing its name or moving jobs outside the country.

PARIS, June 15 — Predictions of imminent AI-driven mass unemployment are likely overblown, but employers will seek workers with different skills as the technology matures, a top executive at global recruiter ManpowerGroup told AFP at Paris’s Vivatech trade fair.
  The world’s third-largest staffing firm by revenue ran a startup contest at Vivatech in which one of the contenders was building systems to hire out customisable autonomous AI “agents”, rather than humans.
  Their service was reminiscent of a warning last month from Dario Amodei, head of American AI giant Anthropic, that the technology could wipe out half of entry-level white-collar jobs within one to five years.
  For ManpowerGroup, AI agents are “certainly not going to become our core business any time soon,” the company’s Chief Innovation Officer Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic said.
  “If history shows us one thing, it’s most of these forecasts are wrong.”
  An International Labour Organisation (ILO) report published in May found that around “one in four workers across the world are in an occupation with some degree of exposure” to generative AI models’ capabilities.
  “Few jobs are currently at high risk of full automation,” the ILO added.
  But the UN body also highlighted “rapid expansion of AI capabilities since our previous study” in 2023, including the emergence of “agentic” models more able to act autonomously or semi-autonomously and use software like web browsers and email.
  ‘Soft skills’  
  Chamorro-Premuzic predicted that the introduction of efficiency-enhancing AI tools would put pressure on workers, managers and firms to make the most of the time they will save.
  “If what happens is that AI helps knowledge workers save 30, 40, maybe 50 per cent of their time, but that time is then wasted on social media, that’s not an increase in net output,” he said.
  Adoption of AI could give workers “more time to do creative work” — or impose “greater standardisation of their roles and reduced autonomy,” the ILO said.
  There’s general agreement that interpersonal skills and an entrepreneurial attitude will become more important for knowledge workers as their daily tasks shift towards corralling AIs.
  Employers identified ethical judgement, customer service, team management and strategic thinking as top skills AI could not replace in a ManpowerGroup survey of over 40,000 employers across 42 countries published this week.
  Nevertheless, training that adopts those new priorities has not increased in step with AI adoption, Chamorro-Premuzic lamented.
  “For every dollar you invest in technology, you need to invest eight or nine on HR, culture transformation, change management,” he said.
  He argued that such gaps suggest companies are still chasing automation, rather than the often-stated aim of augmenting human workers’ capabilities with AI.
  AI hiring AI?  
  One of the areas where AI is transforming the world of work most rapidly is ManpowerGroup’s core business of recruitment.
  But here candidates are adopting the tools just as quickly as recruiters and companies, disrupting the old way of doing things from the bottom up.
  “Candidates are able to send 500 perfect applications in one day, they are able to send their bots to interview, they are even able to game elements of the assessments,” Chamorro-Premuzic said.
  That extreme picture was not borne out in a survey of over 1,000 job seekers released this week by recruitment platform TestGorilla, which found just 17 per cent of applicants admitting to cheating on tests, and only some of those to using AI.
  Jobseekers’ use of consumer AI tools meets recruiters doing the same.
  The same TestGorilla survey found almost two-thirds of the more-than-1,000 hiring decision-makers polled used AI to generate job descriptions and screen applications.
  But a far smaller share are already using the technology to actually interview candidates.
  Where employers today are focused on candidates’ skills over credentials, Chamorro-Premuzic predicted that “the next evolution is to focus on potential, not even skills even if I know the skills you bring to the table today, they might be obsolete in six months.”
  “I’m better off knowing that you’re hard-working, that you are curious, that you have good people skills, that you’re not a jerk — and that, AI can help you evaluate,” he believes. — AFP

ISKANDAR PUTERI: What started as a love for animated science fiction has evolved to passion for robotics for 14-year-old Ethan Ling.
  The SMJK Nan Hwa student from Sitiawan, Perak said when he was younger, he would watch science fiction movies that have robots in them.
  “I have always liked watching robot-themed animations because that is how I see the world will look like in the future.
  “Since I am passionate about robots, my school teachers and family really encouraged me to try robotics when I was 11, and since then I have learned so much,” he said when met during the International Youth Robot Competition (IYRC) Asean 2025 at the EduCity Sports Complex here yesterday.
  The competition saw over 800 young innovators from seven Asean countries taking part in the two-day event.
  He added that he saw IYRC Asean 2025 as more than just a competition among fellow robotics enthusiasts from around the region, but a glimpse into a future he hopes to help build one day.
  “Robots are already changing the world. I believe that they can be used to bring benefit to humans.
  “I want to be part of that change, maybe as a programmer, but if that does not work out, I would love to be a 3D animator creating robot-themed animation,” he said.
  Another participant is 13-year-old Abrielle Siow, from SMK Convent Teluk Intan, Perak, where creating a robot from scratch was a fun challenge for her.
  “Learning how to build and code robots is fun. But sometimes it is really hard, especially when the coding part does not go right.
  “Now, whenever I go to a bookshop, I will buy some books to learn more about programming, including for this competition where I spent two months in training as part of my preparation,” she said.
  Abrielle added that she was looking forward to face other programmers in the competition as it was her first time competing at an Asean-level robotics event.
  She said that this was her fourth robotics competition and had participated in several state-level competitions before.
  “My dream is to become a doctor like my parents. But maybe one day, I can create robotic technology to help treat people, which would be really cool,” she added.
  Meanwhile, IYRC Asean 2025 organising chairwoman Olivia Ooi said the competition was a celebration of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and talents across borders.
  “IYRC Asean 2025 is more than just a contest as it ignites the imagination, nurtures friendships and shapes the region’s future through collaboration and creativity,” she added.
  Ooi also thanked the Johor government, sponsors, educators and parents for their unwavering support in making the event possible.
  She said such cooperation has helped shaped future global citizens, where their unwavering commitment to youth development and innovation help drives such initiative forward.
  “As Asean continues to emerge as a global hub for innovation and talent, IYRC Asean 2025 stands as a testament to the region’s commitment to cross-border collaboration, digital readiness and investment in the next generation of problem-solvers,” she added.

（惠灵顿14日综合电）纽西兰有个妈妈怀孕初期被告知怀
三胞胎
，数周后产检却只剩下一个胎儿，她打趣形容，“这孩子把兄弟姊妹都吃了！”这段经历分享上网后迅速爆红，吸引3000万人观看，引起热议。
英媒《每日邮报》报道，这位妈妈第一次超音波检查时原以为怀双胞胎，没想到发现其实是三胞胎，让她惊讶不已。然而后续检查，萤幕上却只剩下一个胎儿。她在影片中幽默地说：“这家伙很随意地把手足都解决了！”
ADVERTISEMENT
影片结尾，她晒出宝宝出生后模样，只见他戴着毛帽、身穿薄荷绿针织衫，睡得香甜可爱，令人难以想像他曾“独吞”手足。
不少网民对这样的现象感到困惑，纷纷留言询问是否属于“人类嵌合体（Chimera）”现象。医疗网站指出，如果多胞胎中有胚胎早期停止发育，可能被母体或其他胚胎吸收，这就是“双胞胎消失症候群”（Vanishing Twin Syndrome）。“嵌合体”是另一种少见情况，两个受精卵早期融合成一个胚胎，让新生儿同时拥有两组DNA，可能表现为不同血型、皮肤色块、或器官DNA不一致的特征。
留言区有自称“嵌合体”的网民现身说法，自己体内拥有双DNA，甚至皮肤色调左右不同，或体内拥有不同血型。也有网民也分享，自己怀孕初期发现双胞胎，后来却只剩一胎，让这位妈妈感到倍感共鸣，她坦言：“真的只能慢慢接受这样的事。”
当事妈妈也在留言中补充，目前宝宝已2岁，健康成长，是个活泼快乐的小孩。她坦言，当年从三胎变一胎的过程确实带来难过情绪，如今逐渐释怀，“或许他现在拥有三种不同性格，能平安来到这世界，我已经很感激了。”

KUALA LUMPUR: Specialised training for the police’s mounted unit has been mooted by the nation’s top cop to support equine-assisted therapy for children with autism at the Pengaman-PDRM Autism Centre.
  Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain, an avid horse rider, said he had witnessed the positive effects of such therapy on children’s development and believes the mounted unit can play a meaningful role.
  “My intent is for our mounted police officers to undergo special courses in equine-assisted therapy,” he said.
  “I’ve been riding for over a decade and have seen first-hand how this form of therapy benefits children, especially in spurring mental and physical development.”
  He shared an anecdote about his orderly’s autistic child, who experienced noticeable impro­ve­ment after just six sessions.
  “The child began to understand how to get out of bed properly and use brushes,” he said during his speech at the centre’s Autism Day celebration at the Police Training Centre yesterday.
  Razarudin also expressed deep appreciation for the centre’s teachers and caregivers.
  “It’s not an easy task. These children are precious and possess special capabilities and potential that must be given constant support, assistance and guidance.
  “I believe that with early intervention education provided by the 18 staff members, our 50 students here are not only learning but also building critical skills in communication, self-management and social interaction,” he said.
  “We must be a caring community that ensures no autistic child is left behind.”
  Meanwhile, Yayasan Pengaman Malaysia deputy chairman Tan Sri Hussin Ismail said the centre had seen significant growth since it opened on Aug 3, 2020.
  “From three classrooms and 25 children at the start, we’ve grown to six classrooms by December 2024, along with a dedicated occupational therapy room,” he said.
  “We now run structured early intervention programmes for 50 children, offering morning and afternoon sessions, as well as full-day classes and intensive school-preparation modules.”
  The centre is staffed by a team of 18, including a manager, a programme head, officers and assistant intervention officers.
  Hussin said Autism Day was not just a celebration but also a reminder of the deeper social responsibility to support and empower autistic children.
  “The goal is to build an inclusive society where no one is sidelined. Let us shape a future where children on the spectrum are not marginalised but supported with pride,” said Hussin, calling on the public, educators, caregivers and parents to embrace awareness to better understand and support children with autism.
  He also expressed gratitude for the strong support shown by the police force, partner agencies and the wider community, noting that the centre continues to offer quality early intervention services at affordable rates.
  Centre head Azura Izham, who is also general manager of Yayasan Pengaman, explained that autism spectrum disorder is a neurological condition that affects communication, behaviour and social interaction, and presents differently in every individual.
  “Some need high levels of support while others can function independently or semi-independently,” she said.
  While awareness has improved in Malaysia, she said challenges remain in areas such as early diagnosis, access to effective intervention, inclusive education and societal acceptance.
  “As educators, parents and members of society, we must establish an environment free of stigma and discrimination.
  “The Pengaman-PDRM Autism Centre is built on this principle, that every child has potential, and our role is to guide them to realise it,” said Azura.
  The Autism Day celebration also featured engaging activities, including a mock kidnapping rescue demonstration by the Criminal Investigation Department, horseback riding and a safety showcase by the Fire and Rescue Department.

LONDON, June 15 — The survival of a passenger who escaped through an exit door seconds after his Air India flight crashed killing everyone else on board has prompted speculation over whether his seat, 11A, is the safest.
  Aviation experts say it is not so straightforward because aircraft vary widely in seat configurations, crashes are unique, and survival often hinges on a complex interplay of factors.
  “Each accident is different, and it is impossible to predict survivability based on seat location,” said Mitchell Fox, a director at Flight Safety Foundation, a US-based nonprofit.
  Vishwas Kumar Ramesh said his 11A seat was near an emergency exit on the London-bound Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner that crashed in Ahmedabad on Thursday and he managed to walk out.
  Sitting next to an exit door might help you survive an accident, but it won’t always be 11A because aircraft can have dozens of different configurations.
  “In this particular instance, because the passenger was sitting adjacent to the emergency exit, this was obviously the safest seat on the day,” said Ron Bartsch, Chairman at Sydney-based AvLaw Aviation Consulting.
  “But it’s not always 11A, it’s just 11A on this configuration of the Boeing 787.”
  A 2007 Popular Mechanics study of crashes since 1971 found that passengers towards the back of the plane had better survival odds. Some experts suggest the wing section offers more stability.
  Sitting next to an exit door, like Ramesh, gives you an opportunity to be one of the first out of the plane, although some exits don’t function after a crash. The opposite side of the plane was blocked by the wall of a building it crashed into, he said.
  In January of last year, a panel missing several bolts blew off the side of a Boeing 737 MAX mid-flight, creating a gaping hole and damaging the adjacent seat. Fortunately, no one was seated there at the time, and the incident resulted in no fatalities.
  Sitting by the aisle might offer you a speedier escape but it increases the likelihood of being hit in the head by luggage falling out of the overhead bins — a much more common occurrence than major crashes.
  Safety briefings 
  Paying attention to the safety briefing at the start of your flight - often dismissed as routine ‚ is likely the best way to improve your chances of survival, experts say.Disciplined compliance with cabin crew evacuation advice, including leaving bags behind, was a key factor in saving the lives of all 379 passengers and crew aboard a Japan Airlines flight in January last year.
  The Airbus A350 aircraft had collided with a Coast Guard plane at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport, killing five of the six crew members on the smaller aircraft.
  Safety briefings typically cover critical instructions such as how to fasten your seatbelt securely, adopt the correct brace position and plan your evacuation route.
  A common tip is to count the number of rows between your seat and the nearest exit — vital knowledge if the cabin fills with smoke and visibility is low.
  Despite disasters such as the Air India crash, plane designs have evolved to increase the likelihood of passengers walking away from a rare plane accident, Fox said.
  These include floor path lighting, fire detection and extinguishers, less flammable cabin materials and improved access to emergency exits.
  “There have been remarkable advancements in airplane cabin design that have improved the survivability of accidents on or near the ground,” Fox said. — Reuters

BANGKOK: When Thai actor-singer Ruangsak Loychusak saw news of the June 12 Air India plane crash, one detail sent chills down his spine: the sole survivor had been sitting in seat 11A - the very same seat number as Ruangsak’s when he survived a deadly crash nearly 27 years ago.
  “Survivor of a plane crash in India. He sat in the same seat as me. 11A,” Ruangsak wrote in a Facebook post, describing the eerie coincidence that has now captivated the Internet.
  Air India Flight AI171 crashed shortly after take-off from Ahmedabad on June 12. Of the 242 people on board the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, only one - Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, a British national - made it out alive.
  Thrown from the aircraft during impact, Vishwash, 40, suffered multiple injuries but managed to walk away from the wreckage and into a waiting ambulance.
  Speaking from hospital, Vishwash told Indian media: “For some time, I thought I was also going to die. But when I opened my eyes, I realised I was alive and I tried to unbuckle myself from the seat and escape from where I could.”
  Back in December 1998, Ruangsak was just 20 when Thai Airways Flight TG261 crashed while trying to land in Surat Thani Airport in southern Thailand.
  The aircraft plunged into a swamp, killing 101 of the 146 people onboard.
  Ruangsak survived - and over the years, has spoken publicly about the trauma and survivor’s guilt he carried. He reportedly refused to fly for nearly a decade, calling the life he’s lived since a “second life”.
  Now, with both he and Vishwash linked by the same seat number and similar survival stories, interest in seat 11A has exploded online.
  But experts warn that there’s no such thing as a universally “safest seat”.
  While Viswash’s position beside a functioning emergency exit proved critical, that won’t always be the case, experts say.
  “Each accident is different, and it is impossible to predict survivability based on seat location,” said Mitchell Fox, director at the US-based Flight Safety Foundation, in comments to Reuters.
  Aircraft layouts vary widely, and what’s considered a good position in one configuration might not be in another.
  “In this particular instance, because the passenger was sitting adjacent to the emergency exit, this was obviously the safest seat on the day,” said Ron Bartsch, chairman of Sydney-based AvLaw Aviation Consulting.
  “But it’s not always 11A, it’s just 11A on this configuration of the Boeing 787.”
  Aviation safety experts remind passengers that survival often depends less on luck and more on preparedness.
  Listening to the safety briefing, identifying your nearest exit, and following crew instructions without delay can significantly improve your chances, they say.
  It may be tempting to view 11A as a miracle seat. But in the world of aviation safety, every crash is different - and survival comes down to far more than a number, experts say. - The Straits Times/ANN

AHMEDABAD, India (Reuters) -Around 30 minutes before an Air India jet crashed into a college hostel in India, Ravi Thakor, the cook in the hostel canteen, and his wife stepped out to deliver lunchboxes - leaving behind their two-year-old daughter and his mother.
  The grandmother and child are missing. Thakor is hoping for what he calls a "second miracle", one like the astonishing survival of the sole passenger among the 242 people on board the plane.
  Thakor said he first thought the loud bang he heard when the plane crashed on Thursday in the western city of Ahmedabad was a gas cylinder blast, but soon noticed the building he had just left was engulfed in flames. For days, he's been searching for his mother and his daughter at hospitals and the morgue to no avail.
  Police told Reuters they were treating it as a missing persons case.     
  "If one of the plane passengers could survive the crash, there could be a second miracle and my mother and daughter could also be safe," a visibly distraught Thakor told Reuters outside one of the hospitals. His wife Lalita stood beside him, stone-faced.
  "We realise that the chances of finding them alive are bleak but we have not given up hope," Thakor said.
  In all, at least 271 people died in the crash - the 241 passengers and crew in the plane, and the rest people on the ground, mostly in the hostel building.
  Thakor and his wife have given samples of their DNA to hospital authorities but they are yet to hear if any matches have been found among the deceased. 
  Families of victims have been waiting to take posession of their loved ones' remains for days as DNA profiling and other identification checks are taking time. The hospital's additional superintendent, Rajnish Patel, said on Sunday DNA samples of only 32 deceased have been matched so far.
  When the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner jet struck the hostel canteen on Thursday, many students were eating lunch. Steel tumblers and plates still containing food lay on the few tables that were left intact when Reuters visited the site later.
  Thakor's mother was still cooking when he and his wife left the hostel that day to deliver lunchboxes and he had just rocked rocked his daugher to sleep on a wooden swing, he said. "It is possible someone took away my daughter in the chaos that followed," he said.    
  Of the 242 on board the plane, the only passenger who managed to survive was Viswashkumar Ramesh, 40, who squeezed through the broken hatch after the plane crashed and emerged with only minor injuries.

IPOH, June 15 — In a quiet corner of Ipoh’s old town, 57-year-old Kwan Siew Mung spends his days repairing old watches and clocks from behind a modest glass counter.
  As one of the few remaining traditional watch repairmen in the city, Kwan is preserving a craft that is slowly slipping into obscurity.
  “There used to be more than ten watch repair shops here,” he told Malay Mail.
  “Now, from old town to new town, you might find five or six only. And all of us are old. When we close shop, there won’t be anyone left.”
  Kwan first learned the intricacies of watch repair as a teenager, under the tutelage of his father, who ran a small stall along Jalan Market. After completing his Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM), Kwan fully committed to the trade.
  Kwan Siew Mung, 57, showing a picture of his father’s old watch stall also located at Jalan Market in Ipoh. 
  Today, he operates from a small shop he moved into seven years ago, following increased tourism that made it unfeasible to continue working from his father’s corridor stall.
  “This job isn’t about being difficult or easy; it’s about interest,” he said.
  “Without passion, you can’t even fix a single screw properly in the watch, no matter how long you try.”
  Over the past 30 years, Kwan has repaired everything from solar-powered timepieces to 50-year-old mechanical watches.
  “Mechanical and automatic watches are different because they don’t use batteries. They require winding or movement to work. Their build is complex and unique,” he explained.
  A typical watch service takes about 40 minutes to an hour, but vintage timepieces often require weeks or even months, especially if rare parts are needed.
  “If you can’t find spare parts like a tiny spring, the whole repair is stuck. Every component matters, especially for old and rare pieces,” he said.
  Kwan has serviced prestigious brands such as Seiko, Omega, and Rolex, with the most expensive piece valued at RM30,000, even as a second-hand item.
  While his trade no longer attracts the crowds it once did, Kwan’s business survives on repairs, especially for timepieces with sentimental value.
  “People don’t buy watches from us anymore. They go to shopping malls or shop online. But some still come to repair watches that mean something to them,” he said.
  However, he notes a generational shift. “Young people prefer smartwatches, which are cheaper and easier to replace. These can’t be repaired the same way and don’t carry the same sense of status or story.”
  Despite rising costs — RM2,000 a month for his current shop compared to RM300 during his stall days — Kwan remains steadfast in his commitment. Yet, the future of his craft seems uncertain.
  “My children aren’t interested in continuing this business. You can’t get rich from it; you can only survive. In 10 years, I don’t think there’ll be many old watch repair shops left,” he said.
  For now, Kwan stands as a guardian of a meticulous and vanishing tradition — keeping time alive, one delicate repair at a time.

“你知道Emil Chau（周华健）吗？我很喜欢唱《朋友》——朋友一生一起走，那些日子不再有……”
罗哈雅
说这句话时，眼神闪烁着一种难以言谕的怀旧与亲切。对她来说，这首歌不只是旋律动人，更是一段语言与记忆的连结，一座通往不同文化之间的桥樑。

公仆若掌三语可增效率

公务员
体系，若能掌握至少3种语言，即国家语言马来语、英语、
华语
或淡米尔语，将有助于提升执行公务的效率，尤其在与不同族群沟通时更加便利。
其中，负责国家对外事务的外交部作为大马与他国建立关系的门面，若能使用不同语言交流，将提高和巩固大马一直以来建立亲切与多元社会的国际形象。
“但这也有一个小小的坏处。”马来西亚驻昆明副领事罗哈雅（Rohaya Ayob）开玩笑道：“那就是我一个人要做3个人的工作，却只领一份薪水！”尔后，她认真而论，多学一种语言绝对有利而无弊，除了工作机会变多，生活上也不吃亏。

包括跨国婚姻报生登记处理国人在华事务
39岁的罗哈雅，自2019年加入马来西亚外交部工作，2022年被派驻到马来西亚驻昆明领事馆，担任副领事，主要负责处理马来西亚人在中国面对的问题与相关事务，包括跨国婚姻和报生登记。
“比如马来西亚人跟中国人结婚，我就会协助他们申请国民登记局的结婚证件和孩子的报生纸。”她透露，马中之间的跨国婚姻日益增加，其中大多数为大马华裔男子与中国妻子组织家庭。
中文最好 成与中方接洽主力
在整个驻派团队中，罗哈雅的中文水平最好，从公务到旅游，她都是与中国方接洽的主要窗口。她的工作内容还包括接待访华的马来西亚皇室成员与官员，全权负责行程规划和翻译。
“昆明不像北京或上海，这里会说英语的人很少，再加上一些大马人在中国旅居久了，已经快忘记怎样说马来语了，哈哈哈。”罗哈雅并无责怪，反倒乐于成为沟通的桥梁。
2024年，罗哈雅随马来西亚政府官员高级汉语研修班访华团，到访天津蓟县城北的黄崖关长城，并在写有“蓟北雄关”的城关前与团员合影。（照片由受访者提供）
华小毕业打下基础看中文剧唱歌练华语
罗哈雅从小接触中文，曾就读华文幼儿园，小学一年级入读关丹中菁国民型华小，二年级转校至吉打益群华小。6年的华文教育让她打下扎实的中文知识基础，在小六评估考试（UPSR）中的华文理解与华文作文皆考获B级。
“升中学时，我原本报读吉华一校，但因为马来学生不足15人，无法开设宗教课班，3个月后我就转去了国中，班上完全没有华人，自然也没人再跟我讲华语。”
用罗马拼音抄背
歌词
因为这样，收看华语电视剧和唱中文歌，渐渐从兴趣变成罗哈雅练习华语的管道，还用罗马拼音把歌词一个个抄下，背起来。访谈中，她问：“你知道Emil Chau（周华健）吗？我很喜欢唱《朋友》，朋友一生一起走，那些日子不再有……”
随着用华语交流的机会少了，华语渐渐生疏。直到她参加由马来西亚汉文化中心与外交部外交暨国际关系学院（IDFR）举办的官员汉语研修班，才重新建立主动开口讲华语的信心。

官员汉语研修班受马中政府承认
在被派驻昆明之前，罗哈雅于2021年报名参加了汉文化与外交部合作举办的线上官员汉语研修班。对她而言，这更像是弥补多年前无法继续学习中文的遗憾。
学习马中用词
“我觉得自己错过了很多学中文的时间，所以这个汉语进修对我来说非常实用，课堂上不仅学马来西亚本地华语，也包括中国当地用词。”这些知识对她在昆明的工作大有帮助。
“我记得第一次在昆明问路时，问人‘厕所在哪里’，中国人听不懂什么是‘厕所’，我才想起厕所在中国应该是叫‘卫生间’。”
罗哈雅强调，更重要的是，官员汉语研修班结业证书不仅在我国政府部门受用，也被中国政府机构认可，可列入个人履历，甚至作为申请额外津贴的依据。
“汉文化与中国驻马大使馆有密切合作关系，大马官员也因此有了许多机会访华，认识造纸技术、戏曲等中华文化，让我们大开眼界。”
已在中国生活3年的罗哈雅说，昆明彷佛成了她的第二个家乡，不仅熟悉又亲切，还有中国好友陪她一起庆祝生日。（照片由受访者提供）
结识中国朋友昆明像第二家乡
我国驻外外交官一般任期为3年。原本罗哈雅的任期在2025年1月中旬结束，但外交部决定延长她的任期。
“虽然还不知道会延长到何时，但我跟老公和孩子已经适应昆明的生活，我也结识了很多中国朋友，经常参加当地举办的各种活动，感受就像第二个家乡。”
罗哈雅的家乡在吉打本同县，而从吉隆坡直飞昆明的航班只需4小时，对她来说距离也不算太远。
在中国生活了3年的罗哈雅结识了不少中国朋友，日常交流中多了熟悉与温暖。左一为她的儿子里法（Muhammad Rif）。（照片由受访者提供）
中国人倍感亲切外国人讲华语受欢迎
罗哈雅发现，中国人对会讲华语的外国人特别有好感，认为非华裔愿意用当地语言交流，让他们倍感亲切。
“所以我也鼓励在昆明生活的马来同事学一些基本华语，尤其是去金店买金的饰时候，会拿到很多折扣哦！”
她与丈夫育有一名儿子，一家三口现居昆明。12岁的儿子就读当地国际学校，因早期受冠病疫情影响，儿子在一、二年级时的学业严重受影响，所以学校建议先让孩子专注补强英语。
她认为，不管怎样，在中国生活，终究还是得懂一点中文比较方便。
儿子后悔没学好中文
“我曾经在家教儿子一些基本中文，他当时十分疑惑：‘我们是马来人，为什么要学中文？’但到中国念书和生活后，他有点后悔当初没有好好学。”
曾就读华文小学的罗哈雅对毛笔字并不陌生，驻昆明服务期间，她提笔点墨，挥毫写下自己的中文名字。（照片由受访者提供）
对付奥客 方便工作懂多种语言不吃亏
早在2016年，罗哈雅曾在浮罗交怡一家酒店工作，经常会遇到不少“奥客”，例如透过耍赖和投诉等各种花招，想方设法换取免费的住宿、餐券或赠品。面对语言不通又怒气冲冲的游客，很多时候酒店为了息事宁人而让步。但如果没有了语言障碍，酒店职员不仅在处理手续上方便许多，也能避免吃亏。
“当时，我在一家酒店做销售，有一次，两名说中文的外国情侣在酒店大堂用蹩脚的英语跟前台人员争执，投诉酒店的各种事情。”
前台招架不住，马上呼叫罗哈雅求助。
“我静静坐在一旁听他们说话，发现对方是想通过投诉来获得赔偿和换取免费住宿。”罗哈雅便起身表明自己听懂中文，也知道对方的意图。
这对外国情侣露出错愕的表情，接着保持沉默，下午直接提早退房，并未提出退款要求。
跟华人老板关系好转
罗哈雅也分享另一段亲身经历。有次她跟母亲光顾一家华人杂货店，发现一些东西卖得特别贵。讨价还价期间，老板用华语口气不善地形容其母亲是“笨蛋”，让她感到不舒服。
“我悄悄告诉母亲，母亲当场跟老板理论，老板知道后显得有些羞愧。此后每次我们再去光顾，老板总会主动给些折扣，跟华人老板的关系也变好了。”
尤其在马来西亚多元族群的环境，不同种族背景的民众在日常生活中，本来就是在多种语言切换。因此她认为，掌握多一种语言总是好的。
驻昆明服务期间，罗哈雅在书法教室提笔挥毫，写下自己的中文名字，展现对中文书写的亲切感与熟练度。（照片由受访者提供）
续展开汉语研修班外交部鼓励公仆学外语
目前，外交部懂中文的官员仍属少数。即便是驻北京大使馆、驻上海领事馆、驻广州领事馆、驻南宁领事馆及驻西安领事馆的官员，也不见得全数精通中文。
“但近来来外交部已意识到官员学习华语的好处，尤其2024年是马中建交50周年，马中两国在商业、经济等各方面的合作越来越多。”
这也是外交部继续与汉文化合作展开官员汉语研修班的原因之一。
她补充，外交部注重公务员的多语言能力，无论是华语、淡米尔语、阿拉伯语、粤语或方言，都会鼓励和支持公务员提升语言能力，为公务与自身发展加分。

GEORGE TOWN: As school-leavers and parents face pressure to make the right education choices, the Star Education Fair 2025 provides a one-stop platform to explore academic programmes and financial aid opportunities.
  Now in its 38th year, the long-running fair is a rare opportunity to access diverse study options and funding resources under one roof.
  Held over two days until today, the event drew tens of thousands from Penang and neighbouring states on its opening day yesterday.
  Visitors explored over 100 booths representing 57 local and international institutions offering programmes ranging from pre-university to postgraduate levels.
  Students were drawn not just by enrolment perks but also by the chance to engage directly with education providers.
  S. Yamuna, 18, a recent SPM leaver from SM Bukit Jambul, attended with her mother in search of an information technology course.
  “I was in the IT stream at school, which gave me early exposure to software and computing.
  “Now I’m looking for something that matches my interests and is affordable – ideally with scholarship options,” she said.
  Her mother M. Puspa Kumari, 49, appreciated the convenience of comparing multiple institutions in one place.
  “Tertiary education is a big step. This fair saved us the trouble of visiting each campus individually,” she said.
  For Form Five student Jason Lim, 17, the fair was an eye-opener.
  “I wanted to explore both local and overseas universities,” he said.
  “Scholarships and foundation programmes matter a lot to me. Even if I qualify, the cost of living and tuition need to be manageable. I also want a course with strong career prospects.”
  Exhibitors echoed the fair’s importance, particularly in the northern region where such events are held less frequently.
  Patrick Ooi, assistant vice-president of INTI International College Penang, said the fair was an ideal platform to showcase over 50 programmes.
  “We’ve received strong interest, several appointments and even on-the-spot sign-ups.
  “With campuses in Penang, Subang, Nilai and Kota Kinabalu, we cater to a wide range of academic goals,” he said.
  Peninsula College deputy chief executive officer Tan Choo Khuan highlighted the appeal of their “Campus-in-Industry” model.
  “As a subsidiary of PKT Logistics Group, we place students within industrial parks where they can work part-time through our ‘Jom Belajar Sambil Bekerja’ initiative,” he said.
  “They graduate with both academic and work experience certification.”
  Han Chiang University College of Communication (HCUC) vice-chancellor Dr Beh Kok Hooi noted that education fairs serve more than just promotional purposes.
  “They raise awareness on the importance of tertiary education,” he said.
  “With over 70 programmes, we’re the only institution in the northern region offering Chinese Studies from diploma to doctorate level.”
  Organised by Star Media Group, the fair remains one of Malaysia’s longest-running education expos.
  Admission is free, with door gifts for early birds.
  Key exhibitors include INTI International College Penang, Peninsula College, HCUC, Universiti Kuala Lumpur and The One Academy Penang.
  Others include UCSI University, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Universiti Malaya, TARUMT, AIMST University, Open University Malaysia, City University Malaysia, Wawasan Open University, University of Southampton Malaysia and Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia.
  Specialist colleges such as Ko Beauty Academy, Golden Chef College, Travex International College and Akademi Laut Malaysia join international institutions like Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Baptist University and Concord College International School.
  The event also features four booths focusing on TVET, three offering scholarships, three first-time exhibitors, two international participants and three booths centred on English language courses.

GEORGE TOWN: Dash over to the Star Education Fair and myStarJob Fair, both taking place concurrently at the Setia SPICE Convention Centre here.
  Sunday (June 15) marks the final day of the two-day event, and it is drawing large crowds as visitors seize the last opportunity to explore a wide range of academic pathways and career prospects across more than 120 booths.
  The Star Education Fair, now in its 38th edition, is one of the country's pioneering education exhibitions, featuring both local and international institutions offering programmes from pre-university to postgraduate levels.
  A total of 57 institutions are occupying over 100 booths, including Inti International College Penang, Peninsula College, Han Chiang University College of Communication, Universiti Kuala Lumpur (UniKL), and The One Academy Penang.
  The fair also includes four booths focused on Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), three offering scholarships, three first-time exhibitors, two international participants, and three booths dedicated to English language courses.
  The myStarJob Fair, held alongside, features 16 companies and agencies from a diverse range of industries.
  In addition to offering jobs from entry-level to managerial roles, the fair provides on-the-spot interviews, career talks, and skills enhancement sessions to support personal development and job readiness.
  Among the key exhibitors at the job fair are Prudential BSN Takaful Bhd and Manulife Insurance Berhad.
  Organised by the Star Media Group, both events run from 11am to 6pm.
  Admission is free, with complimentary door gifts for visitors.

PETALING JAYA: Defender Stefano Brundo isn’t just bringing his experience to Penang, but also his heart, hunger and humility.
  The 32-year-old Argentine, a familiar name in Malaysian football due to his exploits with Pahang, has officially joined the Panthers and has wasted no time embracing the island club’s ambition and ethos under coach Wan Rohaimi Wan Ismail.
  And Brundo has described himself as a “soldier of the team”, ready to give everything, in any position.
  “I’m here to serve. Whether it’s centreback or midfield, I will do anything the coach demands of me. I am the soldier,” said Brundo.
  “Coach Wan Rohaimi has been very approachable and kind. I admire his ethics and intensity. He expects the best from every player, and that’s something I respect deeply.”
  The decision to sign with Penang came down to a compelling project and an invigorating environment, both on and off the pitch.
  “I was drawn by their proposal. The club are aiming big this season,” said Brundo.
  “The last few years might not have been the best, but this season feels different. There’s ambition to bounce back and achieve great things in the Super League and the cup competitions.
  Yet, the move wasn’t without its emotional farewells. Brundo’s departure from Pahang was a difficult one, a club where he felt a strong connection with the fans and community.
  “It was really tough to leave Pahang. I had the best of times there and received a huge amount of love from the people,” he shared.
  “My gratitude will always be with them, and I genuinely hope they compete strongly this season and the next. They are amazing, and I know that someday, somehow, our paths will cross again.”
  For now, Brundo is fully focused on helping Penang forge a new chapter.

JOHOR BARU: With more than 1,000 enforcement actions already taken against litterbugs in the first five months of this year, the Johor government wants to prioritise public cleanliness by strengthening anti-littering by-laws.
  State housing and local government committee chairman Datuk Mohd Jafni Md Shukor (pic) said a special meeting was recently held to review current laws and enhance enforcement efforts in all local councils.
  “Johor Regent Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim’s decree is very clear.
  “Littering, especially in rivers and public spaces, is an irresponsible act that harms the environment and drains public funds.
  “Mentri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi has also instructed immediate and coordinated action to address this issue, which has long plagued both urban and rural areas,” he said yesterday.
  Mohd Jafni criticised the careless behaviour of some individuals, noting that public money meant for development and services is being diverted to unnecessary clean-up operations.
  “This isn’t just inconsiderate, it’s uncivilised. The lack of civic responsibility is costing us all,” he said.
  He pledged to personally coordinate a stricter and more comprehensive enforcement strategy, adopting a zero-compromise approach to cleanliness.
  Among the proposals discussed were updates to the 2024 amendments of the Cleanliness Prevention by-laws and a stricter application of Section 47 of the Street, Drainage and Building Act 1974, which allows offenders to be fined up to RM500 for littering in public spaces.
  Mohd Jafni said the effectiveness of enforcement methods was also reviewed, including patrols in littering hotspots, the use of body-worn cameras and mobile ticketing devices, as well as collaboration with auxiliary police and other enforcement agencies.
  Between January and May this year, over 1,000 actions were taken, including 181 compound notices in May alone, totalling RM161,500 in fines.
  “While these numbers reflect our continued efforts, they will mean little if we fail to shift the public mindset. Enforcement alone will not solve the problem,” he said.
  To that end, Johor is looking to adopt best practices from countries such as Singapore and Japan, where stiff fines, community service sentences and plainclothes patrols play a major role in maintaining public hygiene.
  “It’s time we adapt these proven methods. A clean culture must be backed by firm, visible and consistent enforcement,” he added.
  In parallel, Mohd Jafni said the state government is also working on a civic education plan and integrated awareness campaigns to instil greater responsibility among residents, especially the younger generation.
  He said these initiatives will be rolled out in schools, night markets, bazaars, residential areas and business premises.
  “Public engagement will be supported through additional warning signboards, social media outreach and partnerships with the Solid Waste Management and Public Cleansing Corporation and community-led teams such as the Johor Baru City Council anti-litter squad,” he said.
  Mohd Jafni said local councils have been told to improve their public complaints systems, speed up offender detection and strengthen inter-agency coordination to ensure faster responses.
  Looking ahead, he proposed that cleanliness be made a key performance indicator in all local authority budgets for 2026.
  “As a government that honours Tunku Ismail’s decree and remains committed to the Maju Johor agenda, we cannot compromise when it comes to cleanliness and environmental care.
  “A clean and dignified Johor is our collective duty, not just in words, but in real, visible action,” he said.

  OAKMONT: Sam Burns earned the halfway lead at the US Open on Friday to boost his hopes of a Major breakthrough at Oakmont Country Club, where Rory McIlroy battled late to make the weekend and holder Bryson DeChambeau missed the cut.
  Burns went out early from the 10th tee and covered the punishing Oakmont layout with the low round of the week, a sizzling five-under 65 that put him at three-under and one shot clear of overnight leader J.J. Spaun (72).

OAKMONT
:
Sam Burns, chasing his first Major title, teed off with a one-stroke lead in today’s third round of the US Open, while second-ranked Rory McIlroy found more misery at rain-soaked Oakmont.
Burns, a 28-year-old American whose most recent win came at the 2023 WGC Match Play, was on three-under par 137 for 36 holes, a stroke ahead of last-pair US playing partner JJ Spaun.
Norway’s Viktor Hovland was two back and the only other player under par as the leaders began their trek over the iconic and intimidating layout in quest of a US$4.3 million top prize.
An inch of rain drenched Oakmont overnight with more today, leaving the course receptive for 67 players making the cut on seven-over 147.
Big names still struggled while others made charges.
Northern Ireland’s McIlroy made bogeys on three of his last five holes to fire a four-over par 74 and stand on 10-over, 13 strokes adrift.
“I was hoping to play better, but I didn’t,” McIlroy said, calling his tournament “pretty average” so far.
“The name of the game this week is staying patient, and try to do a good job of it out there,” McIlroy said.
“But it’s one of those golf courses that you can lose patience on pretty quickly.”
McIlroy, who completed a career Grand Slam by winning the Masters for his fifth Major title, missed a seven-foot putt to bogey the third hole and took a penalty drop leading to a bogey at nine.
He dropped his approach inside four feet to set up a birdie at the 10th but found a greenside bunker at 11 and made bogey then lipped out from inside four feet to bogey 14 and missed the green at the par-three 16th on the way to bogey.
McIlroy found a greenside bunker off the 17th tee but blasted out inches from the hole and tapped in for birdie, only to find the right rough off the 18th tee on the way to bogey.
Asked what he looked for tomorrow, McIlroy said, “Hopefully a round in under four and a half hours and get out of here.”
Scheffler struggling
Third-ranked American Xander Schauffele, the reigning British Open champion, fired a 71 to stand on seven-over 217.
Top-ranked Scottie Scheffler, seeking back-to-back Major titles after taking last month’s PGA Championship, had two birdies and three bogeys in his first eight holes to fall to five-over.
Scheffler opened with a three-putt bogey, dropped in a 13-foot birdie putt on the right side of the hole at two, curved in a 19-foot birdie putt at the par-three sixth but made a three-putt bogey at the par-three eighth and a bogey at nine after a penalty drop.
Two-time Major winner Jon Rahm of Spain sank a birdie putt from just inside 14 feet at the second, made bogey at three after finding a fairway bunker, then sank a 23-foot birdie putt at the par-three eighth to stand on three-over.
There were bright spots, Scotland’s Robert MacIntyre among them.
The reigning Scottish Open champion birdied the second on a 12-foot putt and the sixth from 19 feet to stand two-over after 13 holes.
Third-generation American golf pro Sam Stevens, whose grandfather made 30 PGA Tour starts in the 1960s, was on one-over after he sank a 20-foot birdie putt at the third hole and holed out from just inside 16 feet at the par-five fourth.
Mexico’s Carlos Ortiz was also on one-over after birdies at the fourth and sixth from just inside eight and six feet respectively.
Denmark’s Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen reeled off four consecutive birdies to stand one-over after seven holes.
------------------------------
OAKMONT, United States (AFP): On a punishing Oakmont course famed for crowning first-time major winners, Sam Burns finds himself on the brink of joining a historic list.
  The 28-year-old American will carry a one-stroke lead into Sunday's final round of the 125th US Open after firing a one-under-par 69 in Saturday's third round to stand on four-under 206.
  Burns, who leads compatriot J.J. Spaun and 2013 Masters winner Adam Scott of Australia by one stroke, is among nine first-major hopefuls in the top 10.
  Seven first-time major winners at Oakmont include 18-time major winner Jack Nicklaus, South African Ernie Els and Americans Johnny Miller and Dustin Johnson.
  "It would be incredible," Burns said. "As a kid growing up you dream about winning major championships and that's why we practice so hard and work so hard.
  "The opportunity to win a major is special. I'm definitely really excited for tomorrow.
  "The history here and all the people that have been before me and walked these grounds and played here, it's really special."
  Players with a 54-hole solo lead in a major for the first time, like Burns, have won three of the last five opportunities, including Bryson DeChambeau at last year's US Open, fellow American Scottie Scheffler at the 2022 Masters and Japan's Hideki Matsuyama at the 2021 Masters.
  Close Burns friend Scheffler, the world number one, has taken three major titles, two at the Masters and last month's PGA Championship.
  "Scottie is an incredible player," Burns said. "We spend a lot of time together and being able to talk to him and just learn from him and ask him questions, it has been really cool.
  "He's an easy guy to root for. He happens to be also the best player in the world. But, yeah, it has been nice to pick his brain and ask him certain things."
  Burns, who shares a rental house this week with Scheffler and their families, admits he would love to know some of the major-winning experiences that Scheffler has enjoyed, but not in an envious tone.
  "Yeah, as a competitor, we show up to play to win," Burns said. "Watching him do that and watching him have success, it brings me a lot of joy."
  Putting has been a joyful experience this week too. Burns and Ryan Fox of New Zealand are the only players without a three-putt bogey this week.
  "The course I play at at home, Squire Creek, it has big surfaces and lots of slope," Burns said. "So I think I'm kind of used to having a 15- or 20-footer that may break five or six feet. I like that kind of artistic ability to kind of see the break."
  Burns is known for not making changes in life or golf, but a first major win is one he longs for.
  "My dad has always said you got to dance with who brought you," Burns said. "My coach and I have been working together since I was 15 or 16, and it seems way more complicated to go seek advice from someone else who doesn't know me or my golf swing." - AFP

Sam Burns’ most recent win came at the 2023 WGC Match Play. (AP pic)
OAKMONT
:
Sam Burns outduelled fellow American JJ Spaun down the stretch to grab a one-stroke lead after today’s third round of the US Open, setting the stage for a showdown tomorrow at punishing Oakmont.
Burns fired a one-under par 69 to stand on four-under 206 after 54 holes with Australian Adam Scott, the 2013 Masters champion, and Spaun sharing second on 207 and Norway’s Viktor Hovland fourth on 209.
Burns, whose most recent win came at the 2023 WGC Match Play, and Spaun each found the right rough at 18 but Burns made the green and two-putted for par while Spaun found a bunker and two-putted for bogey.
“I didn’t drive the ball as well as I would have liked, but when I got out of position I did a good job of getting myself back in the fairway,” Burns said.
“I was able to convert some of those and kept the momentum going. That was key to the round.”
Spaun, whose only PGA Tour win came at the 2022 Texas Open, shot 69 and was happy despite the setback at 18.
“This is the best I’ve played in my career, for sure,” Spaun said.
“I’m just happy I’m still within shouting distance – 18 is just a tough hole if you’re out of position. Bogeys happen at Oakmont.”
Scott, the 2013 Masters champion, birdied three of the last six holes to fire a 67.
The 44-year-old can be the second-oldest US Open winner after American Hale Irwin, who was 45 when he won in 1990.
Scott would also have the longest gap between Major titles.
“It would be super fulfilling,” Scott said.
“I really haven’t been in this kind of position for five or six years.
“But if I were to come away with it tomorrow, it would be a hell of a round of golf and an exclamation point on my career.”
Hovland blasted out of a bunker to set up a tap-in bogey at 17, but made bogey from a bunker at 18 to shoot 70.
“I’ve got a chance tomorrow. If I shoot a low round then anything can happen,” Hovland said.
“But there’s a lot of good players around me… That forces me to play some really good golf.”
The four will play in the last two pairings once again tomorrow in a tension-packed final round for the US$4.3 million top prize.
Last-group playing partners Burns and Spaun traded the lead all day, a wild early exchange ending when Burns made a tap-in birdie at the fifth to match Spaun at three-under.
Burns sank a seven-foot birdie putt at the par-three 13th but fell back with a bogey at 16.
Both birdied the 17th before the closing drama.
Mexico’s Carlos Ortiz fired a 67 to stand fifth on level par 210, a stumble at the last hole dooming a bogey-free bid.
Ortiz made the cut for only the third time in 10 Majors and has never finished in a Major top 50.
“It would be great. Winning any kind of tournament is awesome,” Ortiz said.
“I’m just going to do my best and hopefully that’s enough. If not, that’s all I had.”
‘A few silly mistakes’
Stars struggled with second-ranked Rory McIlroy making bogeys on three of his last five holes to fire a 74 and stand on 220.
“I was hoping to play better, but I didn’t,” McIlroy said, calling his tournament “pretty average” so far.
“The name of the game this week is staying patient,” McIlroy said.
“But it’s one of those golf courses that you can lose patience on pretty quickly.”
Northern Ireland’s McIlroy, who completed a career Grand Slam by winning the Masters for his fifth Major title, had bogeys on the third and ninth holes, followed a birdie at 10 with bogeys at 11, 14 and 16 and closed birdie-bogey.
Top-ranked Scottie Scheffler, who won last month’s PGA Championship, fired a 70 to stand on 214.
“I had a hard time getting momentum,” Scheffler said.
“I made a few silly mistakes, a couple three-putts, which is just a killer.”

TAYLORMADE Golf have introduced their all-new R7 Quad Mini driver.
  Inspired by one of the most popular drivers in the company’s history, the R7 (and R7 SuperQuad), the R7 Quad Mini driver pays homage to what’s come before, while creating its own modern identity in the same breath.
  “The R7 Quad Mini driver is one of those projects that got everyone excited from the initial concept, and being able to bring back one of the most iconic clubs in TaylorMade history – the R7 driver – was a dream come true,” said TaylorMade product manager Product Creation Chandler Carr.
  “We couldn’t be more excited to continue setting the pace in the mini driver category.
  “We recognised the popularity of mini drivers both on the PGA Tour and for amateurs and wanted to further push the envelope of what’s possible in terms of both tech and performance,” added Carr.
  “To do so, we looked back on what’s worked in the past and found inspiration from the R7 driver.”
  Released in 2004, the R7 was one of the most popular drivers in the game and captured over 30 wins worldwide, including the 2004 US Open.
  The R7 driver was also the first driver to incorporate TaylorMade’s Movable Weight Technology, which influenced the way the industry thought about adjustability.
  The R7 Quad Mini driver incorporates that same technology, allowing golfers to dial in spin, distance, trajectory and shot shape with precise centre of gravity (CG) placement.
  The Quad Weighting System includes two 13g and two 4g weights with two ports at the back of the clubhead, and one each on the toe and heel.
  “By moving weight and CG towards the front of the club, golfers experience a penetrating ball flight that’s ideal for maximising distance,” said Carr.
  “Conversely, golfers find enhanced control and ease of use from the deck by placing more weight in the back of the club and moving the CG in that direction.”
  “Additional weights can also be purchased for an even greater range of adjustability. A key element in designing the R7 Quad Mini driver was minimising mass in the top of the head.
  “The incorporation of a satin Infinity Carbon Crown allowed our engineers to not only save weight but relocate it to other parts of the head where it’s used more efficiently,” added Carr.
  “Visually, the Infinity Carbon Crown presents a clean, elegant profile that inspires confidence in the playing position.”
  The R7 Quad Mini driver is available in 11.5° and 13.5° lofts. The lie angle is 57°, the head measures 305cc and the length is 43.75 inches.
  for more information follow @TaylorMadeGolfMalaysia on Facebook and Instagram, and for upcoming demo events, product highlights and more.
  The R7 Quad Mini driver is now locally available nationwide and comes with a price tag of RM3,000 a piece.

Keir Starmer said he will accept a recommendation for a national inquiry into grooming gangs. (EPA Images pic)
LONDON
:
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said today he would accept a recommendation for a national inquiry into grooming gangs who sexually abused thousands of girls, having previously resisted calls for a statutory review.
Interior minister Yvette Cooper in January asked Louise Casey, a former senior official, to undertake a “rapid audit” of the current scale and nature of gang-based exploitation in Britain.
“(Casey’s) position when she started the audit was that there was not a real need for a national inquiry, over and above what was going on,” Starmer told reporters yesterday.
“She has looked at the material she has looked at and she has come to the view that there should be a national inquiry on the basis of what she has seen.
“I have read every single word of her report and I am going to accept her recommendation.”
The child sexual abuse scandal, which revealed how gangs of mostly Pakistani men had groomed, trafficked and raped young white girls more than a decade ago, returned to the political agenda this year after US billionaire Elon Musk criticised the British government.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang (third from left) has revitalised the party but seems to have reached a ‘plateau’ when it comes to attracting Malay voters, according to Azmi Hassan. (Bernama pic)
PETALING JAYA
:
Political analysts say Abdul Hadi Awang should step down as PAS president, warning that his continued leadership risks stagnating the party.
Azmi Hassan of Akademi Nusantara said Hadi, 77, can take credit for transforming the Islamic party over two decades of his leadership.
Azmi Hassan.
“He has revitalised PAS, which has gone on to become the best performing party in the last general election,” Azmi told FMT.
However, he said, Hadi has also “hit the ceiling” when it comes to the party’s ambitions at national level.
PAS won 43 parliamentary seats at the 15th general election in 2022, and also controls the state governments of Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah and Perlis.
“But now PAS seems to have reached a plateau when it comes to attracting Malay voters and has failed to woo non-Malays. Hadi’s time is over,” he said.
Party needs new leadership
Azmi said that while PAS boasts a loyal following in the conservative Malay heartland, it has made little headway among non-Malay voters.
To lead the federal government, he said PAS must install a new leadership comprising professionals, and project a broader national image.
Like Azmi, Syaza Shukri of International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) believes PAS is unlikely to make progress unless a new leadership takes over.
Syaza Shukri.
However, she does not think the party will name a professional as its next leader.
“Those who take over will still be from the ulama faction. Someone like Terengganu menteri besar Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar is not considered ‘ulama enough’.
“So there’s not going to be much change in terms of rhetoric towards non-Muslims,” she said.
On June 7, PAS vice-president Amar Abdullah acknowledged that Malay-Muslim parties have struggled to gain the support of non-Malays.
However, Amar said PH’s core support has become increasingly critical of the government led by PH chairman Anwar Ibrahim. He said PAS was targeting this group of voters as the party prepares for the next general election.
Kartini Aboo Talib.
Kartini Aboo Talib of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia says PAS already has capable leaders in its ranks to take over the leadership mantle from Hadi.
She named Samsuri, Jerantut MP Khairil Nizam Khirudin, and Pasir Mas MP Ahmad Fadhli Shaari, as those capable of leading the party to new heights.
Hadi, said Kartini, could be appointed as an eminent advisor to the party.
James Chin of University of Tasmania said Hadi is unlikely to step down.
James Chin.
“He knows he is the glue that holds PAS together,” Chin told FMT. “The PAS we see today basically mirrors Hadi.”
Chin said non-Malay voters will not back PAS even if Hadi is no longer at the helm as other leaders in the party also hold “extreme views” on race and religion.
“Even if Hadi steps down, nothing much will change unless there is an overhaul,” he said.

PETALING JAYA: Presiden Olahraga Malaysia (MA), Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim yakin mampu meraih sokongan untuk terus mempertahankan jawatan No.1 badan induk olahraga itu pada Mesyuarat Agung Tahunan (AGM) di Wisma Majlis Olimpik Malaysia (MOM), hari ini.
  Menurut Shahidan, meskipun berdepan persaingan sengit daripada calon lain yang mendakwa turut memiliki jumlah sokongan mencukupi, beliau percaya dirinya masih mendahului dari segi bilangan pencalonan dan keyakinan akar umbi.
  “Kalau mereka dakwa ada ‘numbers’, mereka patut menang. Tapi bolehkah? Dia tarik seorang, saya tarik lima. Jadi, saya tetap di hadapan,” katanya kepada pemberita, semalam.
  Tambah beliau, ada pihak tertentu yang cuba mencetuskan persepsi negatif dengan bermain sentimen yang boleh mencalarkan imej kepimpinan MA, namun menegaskan beliau tidak akan tunduk dengan permainan sedemikian.
  “Saya diam selama ini kerana saya berkorban. Tapi bila saya nampak mereka cuba korbankan saya pula, saya kena bangkit dan hadapi. Saya tidak akan berundur,” tegasnya.
  Ditanya sama ada beliau merujuk kepada mana-mana individu tertentu yang cuba menimbulkan ketegangan menjelang pemilihan, Shahidan enggan menuding jari, namun menyeru agar semua pihak bersikap jujur dan berani tampil secara terbuka.
  “Saya tak tuding pada sesiapa. Tapi saya pesan, jangan jadi orang yang baling batu sembunyi tangan. Kalau ada hasrat nak cabar, tampil ke hadapan dengan jati diri yang perkasa,” ujarnya.
  Untuk rekod, jawatan Presiden MA bakal menyaksikan saingan empat penjuru melibatkan Shahidan, Timbalan Presiden MA sedia ada, Datuk Mark William Ling Lee Meng; Presiden Persatuan Olahraga Perak (POP), Datuk Karim Ibrahim; dan Presiden Olahraga Amatur Terengganu (POAT), Datuk Wan Hisham Wan Salleh.
  Sementara itu, jawatan Timbalan Presiden juga menyaksikan saingan sengit apabila lima calon mengesahkan pencalonan, iaitu Datuk R. Annamalai, Datuk Karim Ibrahim, Sallehudin Safar, Datuk Wan Hisham Wan Salleh dan Mohamat Hassan.
  Turut hangat dipertandingkan ialah jawatan Naib Presiden dengan sembilan calon menawarkan diri untuk merebut empat kekosongan yang tersedia.
  Mengikut peraturan pemilihan, setiap calon boleh bertanding lebih daripada satu jawatan, namun hanya dibenarkan untuk memegang satu jawatan sahaja sekiranya menang dalam pemilihan hari ini.-UTUSAN

Azmi Hassan berkata Presiden PAS Abdul Hadi Awang (tiga dari kiri) berjaya beri nafas baharu kepada parti tetapi sudah mencapai tahap tepu dalam menarik sokongan pengundi Melayu. (Gambar Bernama)
PETALING JAYA
:
Penganalisis politik berpandangan Abdul Hadi Awang wajar berundur sebagai presiden PAS, sambil memberi amaran bahawa jika kepimpinannya diteruskan ia berisiko menyebabkan parti itu tidak berkembang.
Azmi Hassan dari Akademi Nusantara berkata, Hadi, 77, boleh diberi pujian kerana berjaya mentransformasikan parti Islam itu sepanjang dua dekad kepimpinannya.
“Beliau berjaya menyuntik nafas baharu kepada PAS, yang kini muncul sebagai parti paling berjaya dalam PRU lalu,” katanya kepada FMT.
Bagaimanapun, katanya, Hadi kini sudah ‘mencapai siling’ dari segi potensi parti di peringkat nasional.
Azmi Hassan.
Pada PRU-15 pada 2022, PAS memenangi 43 kerusi Parlimen dan membentuk kerajaan negeri di Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah serta Perlis.
“Tetapi kini PAS seolah-olah sudah sampai ke tahap tepu dalam menarik sokongan pengundi Melayu dan gagal memikat pengundi bukan Melayu. Masa Hadi sudah berlalu,” katanya.
Parti perlukan kepimpinan baharu
Azmi berkata walaupun PAS memiliki sokongan kukuh di kawasan majoriti Melayu konservatif, parti itu masih gagal menembusi sokongan pengundi bukan Melayu.
Untuk menerajui kerajaan Persekutuan, katanya, PAS perlu melantik barisan kepimpinan baharu terdiri daripada golongan profesional serta menampilkan imej nasional yang lebih luas.
Sama seperti Azmi, Syaza Shukri dari Universiti Islam Antarabangsa Malaysia (UIAM) turut berpandangan bahawa PAS sukar untuk maju ke hadapan selagi parti itu tidak diterajui kepimpinan baharu.
Syaza Shukri.
Namun, katanya, beliau tidak yakin parti itu akan melantik profesional sebagai pemimpin baharu.
“Mereka yang akan menggantikan (Hadi) tetap akan datang daripada kelompok ulama. Orang seperti Menteri Besar Terengganu, Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar, pun dianggap ‘tidak cukup ulama’.
“Jadi retorik terhadap bukan Islam tidak akan banyak berubah,” katanya.
Pada 7 Jun lalu, Naib Presiden PAS Amar Abdullah mengakui parti Melayu-Islam itu bergelut meraih sokongan bukan Melayu.
Namun, katanya, pengundi yang membentuk sokongan teras PH dilihat semakin lantang mengkritik kerajaan pimpinan Pengerusi PH, Anwar Ibrahim, dan PAS menyasarkan kumpulan ini menjelang PRU akan datang.
Kartini Aboo Talib.
Kartini Aboo Talib dari Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia berkata PAS sebenarnya memiliki pemimpin yang berwibawa untuk mengambil alih teraju parti itu daripada Hadi.
Antaranya ialah Samsuri, Ahli Parlimen Jerantut Khairil Nizam Khirudin, dan Ahli Parlimen Pasir Mas Ahmad Fadhli Shaari.
Menurut Kartini, Hadi boleh diberikan peranan sebagai penasihat utama parti.
James Chin dari Universiti Tasmania pula berpendapat tidak mungkin Hadi akan berundur.
James Chin.
“Beliau sedar bahawa dirinya adalah ‘gam’ yang menyatukan PAS,” kata Chin kepada FMT. “PAS yang kita lihat hari ini sebenarnya mencerminkan Hadi.”
Chin berkata pengundi bukan Melayu tidak akan menyokong PAS walaupun Hadi tidak lagi menjadi presiden, kerana pemimpin lain dalam parti itu turut membawa ‘pandangan ekstrem’ dalam isu kaum dan agama.
“Walaupun Hadi berundur, tidak banyak yang akan berubah kecuali berlaku rombakan menyeluruh dalam parti,” katanya.

MARANG: Naib Presiden Pas, Datuk Seri Dr. Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar melepaskan jawatan sebagai Yang Dipertua (YDP) Pas Kawasan Marang bagi memberi laluan kepada pemimpin baharu mengetuai kawasan itu.

Beliau berkata, keputusan berkenaan dibuat bagi  memberi ruang kepada barisan kepemimpinan baharu untuk menyambung perjuangan Pas. “Saya undur kerana yakin sudah tiba masanya untuk individu lain menyambung perjuangan. Kepemimpinan ini bukan milik individu, ia milik jemaah,” katanya seperti dilaporkan portal rasmi…

KUALA PILAH: Program Keharmonian Masyarakat Kampung Angkat Madani 2025 Ketua Polis Negara di Kompleks Institut Pengakuan Tasawuf di Kampung Parit Seberang, di sini hari ini menjadi program terakhir buat Tan Sri Razarudin Husain memikul jawatan nombor satu pasukan keselamatan itu.
  Kata Razarudin, beliau tidak mempunyai hasrat untuk meneruskan jawatan sebagai Ketua Polis Negara (KPN) dan akan menyerahkan jawatan itu kepada penggantinya pada 20 Jun ini.
  Tambahnya, keputusan itu juga bagi menghormati ‘hajat’ ibunya supaya beliau tidak menyambung kontrak bagi jawatan itu.
  Katanya beliau, hajat ibunya, Rahmah Ab Rahman, 86, itu juga sudah disampaikan kepada Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim dan menteri berkaitan.
  “Ini program terakhir saya, insya-Allah kalau tiada ada aral, 20 Jun ini serah terima tugas dan paluan berundur akan berlaku. Pertama sekali saya kena beritahu sebenarnya, ibu saya pun ada hadir hari ini dan dia pun cakap kalau boleh jangan sambung-sambung lagi.
  “Sepatutnya saya habis kontrak memang tidak perlu sambung lah. Apabila ibu saya berhasrat macam itu, saya akur, saya pun sudah 68 tahun, hidup sudah lama dengan dia (ibu), sebutan daripada mulut dia itu sebagai satu doa.
  “Saya tidak berani ingkar dengan apa yang dikehendaki ibu saya. Ibu saya punya wish (hajat) itu pun saya sampaikan kepada PM (Perdana Menteri) dan menteri… tidak perlu saya hendak sambung, perlu ada pengganti untuk saya, cukup untuk saya dua tahun,” katanya ketika ditemui pemberita di sini.
  Ketika ditanya mengenai harapan kepada kepemimpinan baharu Polis Diraja Malaysia (PDRM), Razarudin memberitahu perkara itu akan dikongsikan pada Majlis Serah Terima Tugas pada minggu hadapan. – UTUSAN

KUALA LUMPUR: In a surprising twist, Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim has withdrawn from contesting the presidency of Malaysian Athletics (MA), bringing an unexpected shift to the body’s leadership race.
  The announcement was made during MA’s annual general meeting (AGM) held at the Olympic Hotel on Sunday (June 15), where elections for the new term would also be taking place.
  With him out, the race will be among Datuk Seri Mark William Ling (current deputy), Datuk Karim Ibrahim (Perak) and Datuk Wan Hashim Wan Abdullah (Terengganu). 
  "I, Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim, would like to announce that I am pulling out from the election for the upcoming term. I hope the meeting goes smoothly after this," he said. 
  His declaration drew applause from some delegates, but the atmosphere remained orderly.
  Shahidan’s decision comes as a surprise, especially after repeatedly stating his intention to defend the post, citing unfinished plans and a continued passion for developing athletics in the country.
  However, recent controversies may have played a role in his abrupt exit.
  National discus thrower Irfan Shamsuddin recently spoke out against the current leadership, claiming that he faced intimidation and emotional pressure from the top officials within the organisation. 
  His allegations sparked a wave of debate in the athletics community ahead of the AGM.
  Shahidan swiftly denied the accusations, suggesting that Irfan may have been influenced by certain quarters with vested interests in the election outcome.
  "I believe his statements were shaped by individuals with their own motives," Shahidan had said earlier in response to the claims.
  With Shahidan stepping aside, the race for new leadership opens up to fresh faces and possibly a new direction for Malaysian athletics.
  All eyes will now be on how MA reshapes their future and whether it can rebuild trust and unity within the sport, following a term marked by both achievements and internal tension.

QASEH Rania Khairul Najib yang menjadikan Cristiano Ronaldo sebagai idolanya memasang impian besar untuk mengharumkan nama Malaysia sebagai pemain bola sepak wanita negara di pentas Eropah.
  Pemain berusia itu membuktikan impian itu bukan sekadar angan-angan apabila dia berjaya memikat salah sebuah kelab Jerman, VfL Wolfsburg dan ditawarkan tempat dalam skuad belia kelab gergasi Eropah itu.
  Qaseh Rania ditawarkan kontrak selama tiga tahun untuk menyertai skuad bawah 17 tahun (B-17) Wolfsburg.
  Penyertaan Qaseh Rania bersama Wolfsburg bermula dengan tindakan bapanya, Khairul Najib Ibrahim yang menggunakan peluang sebaik sahaja mengetahui Wolfsburg berminat mencungkil bakat tempatan pada 2023.
  Khairul Najib telah menghubungi pejabat itu dan menjalinkan hubungan rapat dengan Ketua Wakil Asia Tenggara kelab tersebut, Ken Hew sehingga Qaseh Rania diberi peluang menjalani sesi percubaan selama lima minggu bersama skuad belia Wolfsburg pada Ogos tahun lalu.
  Dalam tempoh percubaan itu, pemain berusia 15 tahun itu menunjukkan prestasi positif sehingga berjaya memikat barisan kejurulatihan kelab berkenaan dan ditawarkan tempat bersama Wolfsburg.
  Berikutan tawaran itu, keluarganya merancang untuk berpindah ke Jerman tahun ini bagi menyokong kerjayanya Qaseh Rania.
  “Sebenarnya, hasil video profil yang disiapkan oleh bapa, saya menerima tawaran daripada empat kelab luar negara iaitu Amerika Syarikat, Sepanyol, Croatia dan Jerman.
  “Kami pilih Wolfsburg bukan sahaja kerana reputasinya, malah disebabkan sistem sokongan dan pembangunan bakat di Jerman yang lebih menyeluruh.
  “Antara kelebihannya adalah pendidikan percuma, kos sara hidup yang seimbang dengan pendapatan, persekitaran sosial selamat serta kurang isu rasuah atau jenayah,” kata Qaseh Rania.
  Qaseh Rania yang juga merupakan duta German-Malaysian Institute (GMI) di Bangi, ketika ini sedang mengikuti kelas bahasa Jerman tahap A1 hingga C2 untuk persediaan berhijrah ke sana.
  Qaseh Rania mula bermain bola sepak sebagai pemain pertahanan tengah, sebelum beralih ke posisi penyerang kerana dia kerap menjaringkan gol.
  Namun pada usia 14 tahun, jurulatihnya melihat potensi besar dimilikinya dan meletakkan Qaseh Rania bermain sebagai pemain tengah disebabkan kemampuan menjaring gol dan menghantar bola dengan tepat.
  Daripada segi fizikal juga menjadi kelebihan selain, pengalamannya bermain bersama pasukan lelaki seperti Clasico FC, nyata banyak membentuk ketahanan tubuhnya.
  “Walaupun saya perempuan, rakan sepasukan tidak pernah memberi layanan istimewa. Saya sudah terbiasa dengan permainan yang lasak dan kasar.
  “Pengalaman tersebut banyak membantu saya ketika beraksi dengan pasukan Eropah kerana gaya permainan mereka setanding dengan pemain lelaki di Malaysia,” ujarnya.
  Bercakap tentang fizikalnya, ia telah dibentuk melalui latihan konsisten sejak kecil dan amalan pemakanan ketat di bawah pemantauan bapanya yang juga merupakan bekas ahli bina badan.
  Menurut gadis yang memiliki ketinggian 174 sentimeter itu, antara menu wajibnya adalah minum susu sebanyak tiga kali sehari dan mengambil makanan seperti dada ayam bakar, ikan kukus serta empat biji telur setiap hari sama ada direbus atau dimasak ‘scramble’.
  Pelajar Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Puchong Utama (1) itu juga membawa bekalan ringan ke sekolah seperti sandwich telur atau buah-buahan, selain elak makan makanan bergoreng.
  Rutinnya juga agak padat dengan aktiviti bola sepak selepas tamat sesi persekolahan.
  “Latihan dilakukan enam hingga tujuh kali seminggu, di mana jadual bergilir-gilir antara sesi gimnasium dan latihan padang. Pada waktu malam, saya fokus belajar bahasa Jerman atau menyiapkan kerja sekolah,” katanya.
  Qaseh Rania turut mengakui bahawa keputusannya menjadi pemain bola sepak juga tidak lari daripada kedengaran suara-suara sumbang yang mempersoalkan kerana jantinanya, namun dia memilih memekak telinga dan terus mengejar cita-citanya.
  Selain sokongan bapanya, ibunya, Siti Zainah Mahani turut menyokong penuh sukan pilihannya.
  “Kadang-kadang ada yang kata saya tak patut bermain bola sepak sebab saya perempuan. Tapi saya bersyukur ada keluarga dan jurulatih yang sentiasa menyokong saya. Saya yakin, suatu hari nanti saya mampu mengharumkan nama negara di pentas Eropah,” ujarnya.

MAJOR champions, Ryder Cup players and global winners all gathered for the fourth regular event of the Legends Tour season, the Costa Navarino Legends Tour Trophy this week.
  The Legends Tour returned to Greece for the second Costa Navarino Legends Tour Trophy, with Paul Lawrie, Michael Campbell, Scott Hend and Stephen Gallacher headling an international field with players from all six inhabited continents.
  In addition to seven former Ryder Cup players, two-time DP World Tour champion Anthony Wall was making his debut and PGA Tour winner Bo Van Pelt was playing in his first regular Legends Tour event, having made his over-50s bow at the recent Senior PGA Championship in America – the first of three majors that count on this year’s Order of Merit.
  It was another American who wrote his name in the history books last year as Clark Dennis won the inaugural Costa Navarino Legends Tour Trophy with a score of 17-under.
  The Texan was relishing the prospect of defending his title in Greece after enjoying his first visit to the country so much 12 months ago.
  “It was great. The venue was just amazing from the start. I thought the courses were brilliant and we just had a fantastic time the whole week.
  “There’s a lot of history and a lot of fun things to see, and the resort is incredible.
  “I can’t recommend it highly enough for people to go and experience it,” he said.
  Scoring was incredibly low on the Bay 12 months ago, but it was the Olympic where Dennis came to the fore with two rounds of 66 to come through the field and win by four shots.
  “The Olympic is a good course. I thought it was fair. It’s scorable if you drive it in the fairway, but if you start to drive it a little crooked, it can be tough,” he said.

Ayub Abdul Ghani quit a smoking habit so he could donate a kidney to his son, Dr Mohamad Zulkifli, battling end-stage kidney failure. (Dr Mohamad Zulkifli Ayub pic)
PETALING JAYA
:
Most fathers would go to great lengths for their children – and in Dr Mohamad Zulkifli Ayub’s case, his father’s love became his lifeline.
As a 23-year-old medical student back in 2020, Zulkifli was filled with hope for the future. Becoming a doctor was his lifelong dream, and he was the first among his siblings to achieve it.
But everything changed when he began experiencing nausea, dizziness and vomiting. “I went to the hospital where I was diagnosed with end-stage kidney failure,” the 28-year-old told FMT Lifestyle.
The diagnosis was devastating. “I was still young, and it felt like the end of the world. I was so sad,” he recalled. He had to start dialysis immediately.
The first person he called was his mother. She too was living with end-stage kidney failure. “She was so sad. Later, she blamed herself, thinking that the illness might have been hereditary.”
His father, Ayub Abdul Ghani, was equally heartbroken – especially since none of their other children had the disease.
“I tried looking for traditional medicine to help him,” Ayub, 62, told FMT Lifestyle. Sadly, these remedies didn’t work.

Ayub’s grief deepened when seeing his son struggle with the exhausting demands of dialysis.
Zulkifli was undergoing peritoneal dialysis, which he managed on his own while living on campus in Kuantan, far from his family in Kelantan. This is a treatment that uses the lining of the abdomen, or belly, to filter blood inside the body.
“I used to wake up around 6am and carry out dialysis for 30 minutes before heading to class. During lunch, I’d return to my room for another round,” Zulkifli recalled.
“After classes ended at 5pm, I’d do it again, and once more before bed at 11pm,” he added.
Balancing medical school with the physical toll of dialysis was not an easy feat. “I felt tired, and my stomach would feel a bit bloated,” Zulkifli shared.
“I could only drink 500 ml of water a day,” he said, adding that his haemoglobin levels were also low, and he was diagnosed as anaemic.
Things got tougher during his housemanship, which involved tiring, overnight shifts at the hospital. Fortunately, he was posted to a hospital in Kelantan.
Sadly, in 2022, Zulkifli’s mother died from her kidney disease. This happened before he began his housemanship, making an already difficult time for him even harder.
When Zulkifli’s doctor suggested a kidney transplant two years later, his younger sister offered to be a donor. But when she was found to be incompatible, the doctor suggested his father instead.
Ayub agreed immediately, determined to do whatever he could to help his son, although he did admit to feeling nervous as he had never undergone major surgery before.
Ayub’s sacrifice is all the more meaningful as the kidney transplant is successful. (Mohamad Zulkifli Ayub pic)
Still, one major obstacle stood in the way: Ayub’s four-decade-long smoking habit, which started when he was 18. He typically smoked two to three cigarettes every day.
He knew he had to give up smoking altogether if he was to donate a kidney to his son. And as tough as it was, he did.
He ate sweets and fruits instead to curb his cravings, and after three agonising months of battling withdrawal symptoms, Ayub was finally off cigarettes for good.
Constantly reminding himself of his son’s health predicament helped him overcome the smoking habit. It was a sacrifice worth making as the kidney transplant conducted last November was a big success.
Today, life feels promising again for Zulkifli. “I can drink as much water as I want. I feel much healthier, and my anaemia is also improving,” he said, adding that he no longer requires dialysis.
Zulkifli has a new lease of life and it’s all thanks to his father who donated his kidney to him last year. (Mohamad Zulkifli Ayub pic)
As for Ayub, he hasn’t touched a cigarette since quitting, adding that he feels much better without it. And his greatest reward? Seeing his son happy, healthy and thriving.
“This is what a father’s love looks like – being willing to quit smoking just to donate a kidney. It’s a sacrifice so great, it can never be repaid,” concluded Zulkifli.
Happy Father’s Day to all the dads who make sacrifices for their children every day.

The High Court said divorce proceedings were not a platform for public shaming or moral judgement.
KUALA LUMPUR
:
The High Court has allowed an application by a former public servant involved in divorce proceedings to anonymise the names of all parties, despite objections from his wife.
Justice Evrol Mariette Peters ruled against the petitioner-wife, identified as RIN, noting that the trial would reveal personal and distressing details.
“Moreover, the identity of the co-respondent and alleged adulterer—often a source of public curiosity—was deliberately concealed to prevent the proceedings from becoming a platform for public shaming or moral judgement, which is not the role of the family court,” she said in a 21-page judgment.
Peters emphasised that the court’s role is to resolve legal disputes, not to serve as a stage for airing salacious details to the public.
According to court records, the couple had been married for approximately 25 years and have children who are now adults.
Last year, RIN filed for divorce alleging adultery between her husband, anonymised as MIN, and a co-respondent, VIN.
The husband then applied to have all parties anonymised, a move the wife opposed, citing public interest.
However, Peters said the wife should consider that naming and shaming the husband and VIN could ultimately be counterproductive.
“The desire for vindication in the court of public opinion may not yield the sympathy or moral clarity the petitioner expects,” she said.
Peters found no legitimate public interest in the case that would justify departing from the standard practice of anonymising parties in family law matters.
“It is important to distinguish clearly between public interest and the public’s interest,” she said. “Though similar in phrasing, they differ fundamentally in meaning and legal significance.”
She explained that public interest refers to matters that protect the welfare, safety, or fundamental rights of the general public, while the public’s interest refers to curiosity or a desire for sensational details, often driven by voyeurism or media sensationalism.
“This kind of interest, while perhaps widespread, is not sufficient grounds to override established privacy protections,” she added.
The wife’s counsel had argued that anonymity should not be granted as the public had a right to know of the husband’s alleged misconduct.
However, Peters said that although the husband was a senior public servant, he was appearing in court in his personal capacity.
“The law must treat all individuals equally in their private lives. Public status cannot be used either to shield one from legal scrutiny or to justify public exposure,” she said.
She added that the identities and privacy of the couple’s children also needed to be protected.
“In this case, deeply personal and distressing information involving the parties and the co-respondent will be revealed during the trial. This could potentially traumatise the children,” she said.
The wife has filed an appeal with the Court of Appeal.

IT took two mighty swings on a 621-yard hole at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania for Patrick Reed to make history with just the fourth albatross on record at a US Open championship.
  Reed raised his hands to the sky, wondering what happened when he unleashed a 3-wood from 286 yards in the fairway of the par-5 4th hole at the third major of the season.
  It was a beauty. The ball bounced three times then rolled towards the hole and into the cup.
  The so-called albatross is considered the rarest shot in golf, with only a few hundred dropping a year, compared to more than 30,000 holes-in-one.
  Reed said the best albatross he hit came at a tournament in Germany, when he came out in the morning to finish the last four holes after getting rained out the night before. He had two par-5s left and his wife, Justine, was urging him to attack those and get to 3-under.
  He parred the first, then made an albatross, sometimes referred as a double eagle, to close.
  The only one Reed saw came at Dominion Country Club in San Antonio when he was a kid. He hit driver off the deck onto the green while the group in front of him was still putting.
  “They turned around and looked at me, then they all started jumping because they watched the ball roll right past them and disappear,” Reed said. “I didn’t know I could get there.”
  Reed’s achievement in Thursday’s opening round marks only the fourth albatross at the US Open since the event started keeping such records in 1983.
  The 2018 Masters champion joins T.C. Chen (1985 at Oakland Hills), Shaun Micheel (2010 at Pebble Beach) and Nick Watney (2012 at Olympic) as the players who managed it.
  Despite the two, Reed finished at 3-over 73 after finishing with triple bogey on No. 18.
  “I was doing pretty well there until that last hole,” Reed said.
  But Reed was not only one who might have felt a little down. Loads of players got that sinking feeling – straight down into the rough at a brutal and punihsing Oakmont.
  Gary Woodland, the 2019 US Open champion, waved the rules official over. Certainly, a ball buried that deep in the rough had to have embedded into the soft turf below when his off-line drive on the 12th hole landed with a thunk.
  No such luck, the official told him. The rough at Oakmont is just deep – and thick and hard to escape.
  Instead of taking a free drop for an embedded ball, Woodland had to replace it where he found it, get out his wedge, take a hack and pray.
  That resulted in Woodland’s first blemish on a back nine of 6-over 41 on the opening day. It turned a promising round that began with three birdies into a 3-over 73 slog.
  Woodland’s was one of dozens of tales from the rough – gnarly, thick and sometimes downright impossible – that make an Open at Oakmont as tough as they come.
  “I can’t get out of it (the rough) some of the times, depending on the lie,” said defending champion Bryson DeChambeau, who makes a living on overpowering golf courses and gouging out of the thick stuff. “It was tough. It was a brutal test of golf.”
  Scotland’s Robert MacIntyre said: “If you miss the green, you miss it by too much, you then try to play an 8-yard pitch over the rough onto a green that’s brick hard running away from you.”
  Punishing the best in the world is exactly how the superintendents at what might be America’s toughest golf course planned.
  For the record, they do mow this rough. If they didn’t, there’s a chance some of the grass would lay over itself, allowing the ball to perch up instead of sink down.
  The mowers here have blades that use suction to pull the grass upward as they cut, helping the grass stand up straight and creating the physics that allow the ball to sink to the bottom.
  Which is exactly where Rory McIlroy found his second shot, then his third, after failing to gouge his drive out of the lush green fescue located right of all that “regular” rough on the par-4 fourth. He made 6 there on his way to 74.

  IN this second part on fairway woods, we see that club golfers struggle with woods as the shot can indeed be intimidating.
  Modest loft on the face and a ball sitting tight to the turf does not look anywhere near as enticing as a 7-iron on a tee, but the harder you try to force this shot, the worse your results will be.

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysians must remain vigilant against individuals acting as proxies for foreign powers, warns Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
  Delivering a strongly worded speech at the National Training Week 2025 summit here yesterday, Anwar emphasised Malaysia’s unwavering commitment to sovereignty and justice, urging the public to reject subversive elements.
  “Let there be no instigators. Do not allow provocateurs or foreign agents to undermine what we have built.
  “There are those who, out of envy or on behalf of foreign powers, aim to destabilise our country and erode our values,” he said.
  Anwar referred to a 2022 incident in which a Malaysian couple allegedly assisted operatives from the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad in entering the country via Thailand.
  “I commend our police force for successfully arresting and charging those involved,” he said.
  Anwar also stressed that a true “Negara Madani” must uphold both national sovereignty and moral clarity, particularly on global issues such as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
  “Just yesterday (Friday), Israel launched another brutal assault. We strongly condemn such attacks.
  “How is it that one country is permitted to commit such acts of violence repeatedly and with impunity?
  “What’s more troubling is when people in Malaysia, an independent nation, are afraid to speak out,” he said.
  He urged Malaysian youth to be discerning and not easily swayed by what they see online.
  “Do not be naive. Do not be deceived by what you see on social media,” he said.
  Anwar’s remarks came amid Israeli airstrikes on Iran, which he condemned as part of a long-standing pattern of aggression.
  Reaffirming Malaysia’s position, he said the country’s principled stance on Gaza would not be compromised, regardless of external pressure.
  “This is what it means to be a Negara Madani. We do not care whether certain countries approve or not,” he said.

LUMUT, June 15 (Bernama) -- Malaysia upholds the sovereign rights of all nations, including Iran, which was the victim of a recent Israeli attack, said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
  He said Malaysia, as a sovereign nation, must stand with Iran in its act of retaliation against Israel, to defend its rights and national dignity.
  “That is why I told my Cabinet colleagues, Malaysia must demonstrate its strength. We are an independent, sovereign nation, and we must stand up for the rights of our friends, including Iran, which has been wronged. We defend Iran’s right to retaliate in order to uphold its national dignity,” he said.
  The Prime Minister said this at the closing ceremony of the Perak MADANI Rakyat Programme (PMR) 2025, at Lumut Waterfront, here, today.
  On Friday, the Israeli military launched airstrikes on Iran, targeting several nuclear and missile facilities, resulting in the deaths of several Iranian military commanders and senior scientists.
  In retaliation, Iran fired ballistic missiles at multiple locations in Israeli-occupied territory, causing fatalities, injuries, and damage to buildings.
  According to a report by Iran’s Tasnim news agency, cited by Anadolu Ajansi (AA), Israel launched another attack early Sunday morning, targeting the Iran’s Defence Ministry headquarters in Tehran.

Perdana Menteri Anwar Ibrahim berkata Iran mampu bina keupayaan sendiri dalam pelbagai aspek termasuk ketenteraan walaupun berdepan sekatan ekonomi berpanjangan.
LUMUT
:
Malaysia mempertahankan hak kedaulatan setiap negara termasuk Iran yang diserang Israel baru-baru ini, kata Perdana Menteri Anwar Ibrahim.
Beliau berkata, Malaysia sebagai sebuah negara berdaulat, bersama dengan Iran dalam mempertahan hak serta maruah negara.
“Sebab itu saya beritahu kawan-kawan saya dalam Jemaah Menteri, Malaysia ini biarlah ada keupayaan. Kita negara merdeka, kita berdaulat dan kita mesti pertahankan hak sahabat-sahabat kita termasuk Iran yang telah dizalimi, dan kita pertahankan hak Iran untuk serang balas mempertahankan maruah negara mereka,” katanya.
Perdana menteri berkata demikian ketika berucap pada Majlis Penutupan Program Madani Rakyat (PMR) 2025 Perak di Lumut Waterfront.
Jumaat lalu, Israel melancarkan beberapa siri serangan terhadap wilayah Iran yang mengorbankan beberapa pegawai kanan tentera dan saintis negara itu, dan sebagai tindak balas, Iran melancarkan peluru berpandu balistik ke beberapa lokasi di Israel, mengakibatkan beberapa kematian dan kecederaan.
Menurut laporan agensi berita Tasnim yang dipetik oleh Anadolu Ajansi (AA), pada awal pagi Ahad Israel sekali lagi menyerang ibu pejabat Kementerian Pertahanan Iran di Tehran.
Anwar turut menyentuh ketahanan Iran yang membina keupayaan sendiri dalam pelbagai aspek termasuk ketenteraan, walaupun berdepan sekatan ekonomi berpanjangan.
“Iran buat penyelidikan, disiplinkan anak-anak mereka untuk belajar kecerdasan buatan (disebabkan banyak pihak) yang tak bagi kerjasama… tapi dia mampu belajar.
“Malah, misil antibalistik Iran boleh sampai ke Tel Aviv untuk serang balas (terhadap Israel),” kata perdana menteri.
Anwar turut mengkritik pendirian kebanyakan negara Eropah yang tidak bersetuju dengan tindakan Iran menyerang balas Israel.
“Banyak negara-negara Eropah serang (kritik) dan marah Iran. Bila Israel serang, kamu (negara-negara Eropah) diam…Alhamdulillah pimpinan kerajaan Madani ini tetap berpegang kepada prinsip membela hak dan pertahankan hak semua negara,” katanya.

FOR over a decade, cases of non-consensual intimate imagery online were often linked to blackmail by loan sharks, spurned lovers and others. Victims were threatened with the release of private images – often taken through coercion or during past intimate relationships – unless they complied with demands such as repaying loans or enduring acts of revenge, commonly referred to as “revenge porn”.
  Today, while elements of blackmail remain, the threat has evolved. Such imagery can now be fabricated entirely through artificial intelligence, using deepfake technology to produce non-consensual pornography without the victim’s knowledge or participation. Here are the recent cases:
  > April 2025:  A 16-year-old school student in Kulai, Johor, was arrested by the police for selling deepfake pornographic images on social media.
  He had superimposed the faces real women and girls onto pictures of naked bodies without consent or knowledge.
  The boy was taken before the court and had claimed trial, although he pleaded guilty to possessing 14 pornographic images on his mobile phone.
  > April 2025:  Four people were arrested by the police and over 50,000 items were seized that contained child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and adult pornography that was being shared through peer-to-peer networks via online platforms.
  Deputy Inspector-General of Police Datuk Seri Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said the arrests were made following a large-scale operation called Op Cyber Guardian that was carried out in Selangor and Pahang.
  He said among those arrested were an accountant, a technician, a web designer, and a public servant.
  > May 2025:  A woman in Kuala Lumpur fell victim to an extortion scam when she was coerced into sending nude photographs as a form of “guarantee” for a loan repayment.
  She had applied for a loan of RM3,000 and provided her personal details before the scammers instructed her to make an upfront payment of RM2,000 as a processing fee.
  When she was unable to make the payment, the scammers threatened to release her nude photos online unless she complied with their demands. — Compiled by SYED UMAR ARIFF

WHEN the United States passed the Take It Down Act recently, it was seen as a long overdue move to tackle the rise in “deepfake porn” or artificial intelligence-generated non-consensual pornography.
  The law prohibits anyone from knowingly publishing non-consensual intimate content, whether deepfake or not, and as its namesake suggests, the law also requires social media platforms to take down any non-consensual intimate images within 48 hours upon a report or request from users.
  But the problem of deepfake porn is not limited to just the US; in recent years, Malaysia has seen a proliferation of AI-generated explicit content being posted online.
  It was previously reported that last year, the Malaysian Communication and Multi-media Commission (MCMC) removed 1,225 postings of explicit content generated by AI as of Dec 1 – a dramatic jump from 186 such cases just two years earlier in 2022.
  In April this year, news broke about a case involving artificially-generated obscene images of students in Johor, with Deputy Communications Minister Teo Nie Ching calling for stronger digital safety measures in schools in the aftermath.
  Education Minister Fadhlina Sidek issued a similar call this week as she urged for indecent social media pages to be taken down swiftly, following reports of a Facebook group circulating photos of underage students with sexually charged comments.
  Her comments came just days after the gazettement of the Online Safety Act (Onsa) 2025 – legislation which is meant to strengthen online protections and hold platforms more accountable.
  But while Onsa also introduces a takedown mechanism for harmful content, lawyers and women’s rights advocates say its vague language and failure to explicitly cover non-consensual intimate content involving adults leave significant gaps in protection for survivors.
  Takedown limitations 
  Make no mistake, Onsa is a timely update to Malaysia’s digital safety laws because it also introduces a takedown mechanism, says Bar Council Cyber and Privacy Laws Committee head Sarah Yong.
  The mechanism in Onsa allows users, including victims of online sexual exploitation, to report harmful content directly to licensed social media platforms and the MCMC, she says.
  While Onsa considers any child sexual abuse material as “priority harmful content”, Yong says adults depicted in sexual abuse materials such as in deepfake porn may fall under other harmful content categories such as “obscene” or “indecent content”.
  However, lawyer Daniella Zulkifli points out that Onsa only imposes a duty on licensed service providers to establish a mechanism to make “prioritised harmful content” inaccessible.
  As non-consensual intimate imagery such as deepfake porn involving adults is not included as “priority harmful content”, the takedown provision may not apply to it.
  “We need to include non-consensual intimate content as priority harmful content given the nature of it and how damaging it is to someone.
  “We do need to improve on our existing laws to allow for a swift takedown of non-consensual intimate content involving children as well as adults,” says Daniella.
  Other laws, such as the Sexual Offences Against Children Act, the Penal Code and the Communications and Multimedia Act, can cover non-consensual intimate content, she adds, but none of them compel online platforms to remove such content.
  Yong says Onsa is also limited when it involves foreign platforms that are not licensed in Malaysia.
  “In this circumstance, the MCMC could instruct a licensed network service provider to restrict the relevant parts of its network service.”
  While this would technically cause the content to be inaccessible to all users of the network, Yong says there are ways to circumvent this.
  Survivor-centric approach 
  While Onsa serves its purpose of monitoring and regulating content to a certain extent, Women’s Aid Organisation (WAO) advocacy officer Tamyra Selvarajan critiques it for having vague language and failing to address underlying issues such as transparency and accountability.
  She also points out that the provisions in Onsa are heavily fixated on content moderation, which she says is not the issue at hand.
  “Rather, it is the design of the platform and the lack of user education.”
  It is also important to note that deepfake porn is a matter that disproportionately affects women and marginalised communities, says Selvarajan, making this both a digital safety issue and a gender issue.
  “There is still a fundamental need to ensure that these authorities are used in a transparent, rights-respecting and gender-inclusive manner,” she says.
  Thus, for Malaysia to emulate a law like the Take It Down Act in the US, she says there is a lot to be considered.
  “Firstly, there needs to be a survivor-centric approach when it comes to reporting and taking down such content while also safeguarding freedom of expression and privacy.”
  This should include survivor- sensitive processes built into the system, Selvarajan says.
  “When implementing such policies, intersectionalities such as ethnicity, class and, of course, a woman’s standing must be taken into account.”
  But Selvarajan warns that though the Take It Down Act is “somewhat of a win” for Trump’s administration, it has been criticised for being vague and overbroad.
  Daniella also points out that freedom of speech advocates have flagged the law as lacking critical safeguards against misuse.
  “We should take note of the same.”

IN a country where pets are increasingly seen as family and livestock remains vital to the economy, the veterinarian’s role is more crucial than ever.
  From ensuring animal health to supporting public health efforts, veterinarians play a wide-ranging and meaningful role in society, said Medic Pro Link Sdn Bhd senior consultant Alex Partthiban.
  According to Alex, veterinary medicine is about heart, care, and improving lives across species.
  “You’ll be making a difference not just in the lives of animals, but also in the health of communities and the safety of our food systems,” he said, adding that in Malaysia, these skills are desperately in need.
  “Veterinary medicine offers not only strong job prospects but also a fulfilling and rewarding career path – one that more students in Malaysia should consider.
  Alex
  “The reference to veterinarians as ‘Doktor Lembu’ (Cow Doctor) is a thing of the past,” he said, adding that today, with advancements in technology and a growing global population, societies around the world are faced with numerous challenges – ranging from food supply chain management and disease control to even smuggling prevention.
  “Veterinarians play a crucial role across all these fields, and their contributions are increasingly being acknowledged,” he said.
  Decades-long shortage 
  Alex also highlighted that Malaysia has long faced a shortage of veterinarians, with demand consistently outpacing supply.
  “Malaysia only has two veterinary schools, compared to 32 medical schools for human medicine – 11 public and 21 private. Yet, the demand for vets keeps growing.
  “Currently, Malaysia has approximately 2,300 registered veterinarians.
  “According to international standards, we should have one vet for every 5,000 people, but in Malaysia, we have one for every 14,300 people,” he said.
  He added that to close this gap, the country would need at least 6,400 more veterinarians – a number that current local universities are far from meeting.
  “We’re only producing about 220 vets a year. At this rate, it will take us 30 years just to meet today’s demand, assuming the population doesn’t grow – which it will,” he noted.
  The shortage, he said, is made more dire by the rising number of pet owners and the country’s reliance on animal-related industries including agriculture, food safety, and zoonotic disease control.
  “Roughly 59% of Malaysians own pets, but we only have around 650 authorised vet clinics in the country. It is also easier for a vet to get a practising licence and start a career overseas,” he said.
  Annawi
  Opportunities abroad 
  Alex said securing a seat in local public universities can be highly competitive, due to the limited number of slots available and the high demand from a large pool of applicants.
  However, he said, there are still opportunities to pursue veterinary studies in countries like Indonesia, which is home to top veterinary schools like Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) and IPB University.
  “These institutions are fully recognised by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA), with UGM’s veterinary degree approved as equivalent to that of Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM).
  “This makes it easier for Malaysian graduates to return and practise professionally after completing their degrees,” he said.
  Shedding more light, Zara Zakiah Education Sdn Bhd marketing manager Annawi Shamsudin said the two universities in Malaysia that offer veterinary programmes are UPM and Universiti Malaysia Kelantan (UMK).
  “UPM, the main public university offering veterinary medicine locally, has only 150 seats available annually across all its majors, and UMK offers just 50 seats for veterinary medicine,” he said.
  He said Malaysian students should know that Indonesia is a practical and accessible destination to pursue the field.
  He noted that while countries like Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand offer reputable veterinary programmes, the cost can be prohibitive – ranging between RM500,000 and RM700,000.
  In contrast, he said, Indonesia presents a much more affordable option, with the total cost averaging around RM150,000 for a full veterinary degree.
  “Bangladesh is even lower at around RM60,000, but Indonesia is often the preferred choice because of its proximity, familiar culture, and quality of education,” he said, adding that more importantly, degrees from Indonesian universities like UGM and IPB are recognised by both the Malaysian Veterinary Council (MVC) and the MQA.
  Mohammed Shoaib
  Brace for rigour 
  For aspiring veterinarians, understanding what lies ahead in their academic journey is important, said Alex.
  “Veterinary medicine is a biology- and organic chemistry-heavy discipline.
  “Students will need to have a strong grasp of subjects like anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, microbiology and pathology,” he said.
  He explained that whether students study locally or in Indonesia, the core subjects are largely the same.
  In Indonesia, he said, veterinary studies are divided into three main phases: pre-clinical, para-clinical, and clinical and practical.
  “The pre-clinical stage is where the groundwork is laid.
  “This is followed by the para-clinical phase, which includes clinical pathology, radiology, diagnostic imaging, and clinical biochemistry,” he said, adding that there will be more lab-based learning but limited direct contact with live animals.
  “In the final phase, students undergo practical training through internships and field rotations, spending time in real veterinary settings.
  “This is where they transition from theory to real-world application,” he said.
  Beyond academic ability, he stressed that students pursuing veterinary medicine must possess a genuine interest in animals, resilience, and a strong work ethic.
  “Veterinary science isn’t just about loving animals – it’s also about science, discipline and practice,” he said.
  He urged students coming from the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM), Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) or equivalent qualifications to be mentally prepared for the scientific rigour of the programme.
  “If you’re strong in biology or chemistry, and passionate about the field, veterinary medicine can be incredibly rewarding,” he said.
  He added that for students who are passionate about the medical field but seek a path with less psychological pressure from treating human patients, veterinary medicine offers a fulfilling alternative that lets them apply their love for life sciences and healing in a different yet equally meaningful environment.
  Bright prospects 
  Upon graduation, Alex said, Malaysian students can expect starting salaries of RM3,500 without their Animal Practicing Licence (APC), and RM4,500 or more once licensed.
  “Many clinics contact us directly to recruit graduates; the demand is that high,” he said.
  He also said the career path is broader than many expect.
  “In addition to private clinics, veterinarians in Malaysia can work in government and regulatory agencies, academic and research institutions, meat and food safety inspection, livestock and animal health industries, animal welfare nonprofit organisations, and international organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO) or the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).
  “There are also emerging non-traditional fields like One Health – which integrates veterinary, medical, environmental and policy expertise,” he said, adding that there are niche careers veterinarians can pursue such as wildlife crime investigation and even journalism.
  “Veterinarians are on the front lines of identifying and controlling diseases that can jump from animals to humans,” Alex added.
  Meanwhile, Annawi said the veterinary field should be promoted to students not only as a career of compassion, but also as one of critical national importance.
  “We need to show young people that being a vet means being part of a larger system,” he said, adding that Malaysia, as a country with significant agricultural and ecological diversity, urgently needs more veterinarians in roles that go far beyond companion animal care.
  “Veterinarians can work in biosecurity, halal meat certification, vaccine development, and more.
  “These are areas where the demand is rising – but where public awareness is still low,” Annawi explained.
  He also said that the key to attracting more students lies in reshaping the narrative.
  “Let’s move past the stereotype of the vet with a dog on the examination table.
  “It’s a powerful, multifaceted profession that intersects with science, ethics, law, and international development.
  “Students who are curious and driven to make a difference in the world should take a serious look at veterinary medicine,” he said.
  Note: The interviewees were exhibitors at the Star Education Fair 2025, which was held at IOI Grand Exhibition and Convention Centre, Putrajaya, from May 17 to 18. Among other exhibitors at the fair included Newcastle University, Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN), Universiti Kuala Lumpur (UniKL), Multimedia University (MMU), and Universiti Malaya (UM).
  Shaping animal health heroes 
  Veterinary medicine in Malaysia is gradually gaining more recognition, especially as public awareness of animal welfare, food safety, and zoonotic diseases increases. However, many still view veterinarians as simply “pet doctors”, without fully appreciating their critical roles in research, public health and environmental conservation. To better promote veterinary medicine to young students, we need to start early – by integrating animal science and veterinary topics into science clubs and STEM programmes. Loving animals is a great start, but veterinary medicine demands much more – it’s a science-based field that requires emotional resilience, and a genuine commitment to animal and public health. My advice is to see why you want to become a veterinarian. Is it just about caring for pets, or are you curious about biology and animal behaviour? Speak to current students or recent graduates so they can give you more insight. What’s important is having the right mindset for a meaningful career.
  GSC Global Solutions chief executive officer and founder Mohammed Shoaib Chy 
  Veterinary medicine often lags behind human health professions in terms of visibility, perceived prestige, and support. Some ways to improve its promotion among young students include early exposure in school, highlighting its career diversity, and mentorship and outreach programmes to guide and inspire aspiring veterinarians by providing real-life insights into the profession. Students considering this path should build a strong foundation in science, particularly in biology and chemistry, which is essential. It is also important to understand the emotional side of the profession, such as coping with animal loss, managing difficult decisions, and supporting clients through challenging situations.

Resilience, lifelong learning, and unwavering service to the nation are values the TARCian community holds dear, as exemplified by Tan Sri Chan Kong Choy.
  Its deputy chairman Tan Chee Kian said the Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology (TAR UMT) alumni council (TAC) was proud to honour the accomplished leader’s legacy – one built over decades of public service, education and above all, steadfast support for his alma mater.
  Speaking at Chan’s 70th birthday dinner celebration on May 15, Chee Kian described the former as an “inspiration to us all”.
  Organised by TAR UMT and TAC, the dinner brought together over 150 of the varsity’s staff, alumni, students and close friends to celebrate Chan’s birthday – which fell on May 17 – and to show their appreciation for the board of governors (BOG) and TAC chairman, who has been instrumental in growing the TAR UMT Student Loan Fund and supporting the production of The Story of TARCians, Malaysia’s first university-produced film that was screened in cinemas nationwide.
  Chan’s journey with TAR UMT began during his tertiary education, when he enrolled in the then TAR College (TARC) before later returning to serve as a TARC council member. In 2023, he took on the role of TAC chairman and was subsequently named BOG chairman.
  “When I agreed to attend this dinner, I thought it would be a small gathering. I am so happy to see so many of my friends and peers, including my mentor (former Human Resources minister) Tan Sri Lim (Ah Lek) here.
  “TAR UMT means a lot to me. I was not a hardworking student, so my high school grades were not impressive.
  “When I got to know about TAR College, I realised that this was my last chance to change my life through education. I was given a whole new lease of life, which led me to become the man I am today.
  “For that, I will always be grateful to my alma mater, TAR UMT,” said an emotional Chan to rousing applause.
  TAR UMT president Prof Datuk Dr Lee Sze Wei said, “Tonight, we celebrate a remarkable man who has become a pillar of our university. Tan Sri Chan has been instrumental in shaping the long-term vision and path of the university through his strategic leadership and inspirational generosity.”
  During the dinner, Chan and his guests – including Tan Sri Liow Tiong Lai, Datuk Dr Mah Hang Soon, Datuk Seri Yew Teong Look, Datuk Khoo Chin Guan, Datuk Seri Dr Hou Kok Chung, Datuk Chong Sin Woon, Datuk Dr Gue See Sew, Datuk Dr Pamela Yong, Bobby Tan Soy Mok and Wong Cheng Siung – were treated to orchestral and singing performances by the varsity’s young talents.

University students took centre stage at the inaugural Malaysian Advertisers Association (MAA) Trailblazers: The Ad-venture Challenge, sweeping two of the top three spots, including the coveted champion’s title.
  Designed to mimic the real pace and pressure of life in the marketing industry – from rapid-fire ideation to juggling competing tasks and presenting improvised elevator pitches – the Amazing Race-style marketing competition saw Malaysia’s brightest young marketers – many still in university – outshine agency pros and industry veterans as they raced from challenge to challenge, putting their creativity and teamwork to the test.
  The top team, AiScReam, comprising Sunway University students Alycia Yap Kay Lynn, Cheah Renee and Wong Zi En, captured the judges’ attention with their inventive strategies, quick thinking and infectious team spirit – proving that bold ideas and fresh perspectives can take on the best in the business.
  Champs: (From left) Cheah, Yap and Wong celebrating their win with (from right) Claudian, MAA vice president and event organising chair Foong Ai Peng, and Billups managing director (Southeast Asia) Angie Cutter.
  Hot on their heels was Team TD from Taylor’s University. Abdul Hafidz Abdul Halim, Nik Farra Arisha Shaharin and Safiyya Sheriza claimed second place after a fierce, day-long contest.
  Industry participants Daryl Cheong, Jasmine Reynell and Melanie Woo, from a brewing company, took third place.
  Held on May 23 at KL Wellness City, the challenge aimed to nurture the next generation of marketers, encourage creativity and build future-ready advertising talent,
  It saw the participation of students, agency professionals and industry veterans from across Malaysia.
  MAA president Claudian Navin Stanislaus said seeing two student teams take the top spots was a “nice twist”, as it meant the future of the industry was bright.
  “What brought a smile to me was seeing the full spectrum of the industry – young and senior – running around excitedly, having fun, with energy and ideas, away from the confines of the walls and boundaries that often keep us apart,” she said in a press release.
  Sunway University academic Fahizah Shamsuddin said seeing the students overcome challenges and make it into the top three was an incredible moment of pride.
  “The experience really showed me that theory and industry experience matter, but it’s teamwork and putting knowledge into practice that make all the difference,” she said.

KUALA LUMPUR: A shooting at a restaurant in Brickfields left one man dead and two others injured – the motive for which police are still trying to determine.
  Brickfields OCPD Asst Comm Ku Mashariman Ku Mahmood said the brazen attack happened at about 10.50pm on Friday along Jalan Tun Sambanthan.
  The three victims, aged between 30 and 50, were with friends when two men on a motorcycle approached and one of them opened fire, he told reporters at the scene.
  “One of the victims died on the spot while the other two were rushed to Universiti Malaya Medical Centre for treatment.
  “Of the injured, one remains in serious but stable condition while the other suffered minor injuries and was treated as an outpatient,” he added.
  ACP Ku Mashariman said a post-mortem would be carried out on the deceased.
  Police are reviewing CCTV footage of the shooting to determine the motive behind the attack.
  “We are confident that the suspects will be identified soon,” said ACP Ku Mashariman, urging anyone with information to come forward and assist in the investigation.
  He added that police have yet to determine whether the assailants were locals or foreigners.
  The shocking attack was captured on video, showing one of the victims being gunned down at close range while others at the table scrambled in panic.
  Another victim was also shot while the gunman fled moments later on a waiting motorcycle.
  A second clip showed chaos erupting inside the restaurant, with patrons and workers running for cover and some hiding behind tables.
  One of the victims could be seen collapsing near the entrance.

KUALA LUMPUR: Twelve individuals have been named as the founding board members of the Malaysian Media Council (MMC).
  Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil said the members consist of representatives from four different categories of the media industry.
  The categories are media companies, media associations, media professionals and independent media practitioners, as well as non-media practitioners.
  “After 50 years, we have finally passed the law in Parliament,” he said in his speech at the National Journalists Day (Hawana) 2025 celebration here yesterday.
  The board members are MalaysiaKini co-founder and MMC pro-tem committee chairman Premesh Chandran, National Union of Journalists Malaysia general secretary Teh Athira Yusof, Astro Awani chief editor Ashwad Ismail and Gerakan Media Merdeka president Radzi Razak.
  Also appointed are Borneo Post and Utusan Borneo general manager Wong Yang Yong, Daily Express chief editor Datuk Sardahthisa James, Journalists Association of Kuching Division Sarawak president Ronnie Teo Teck Wei and Malaysian Tamil Media Organisation president Muthameez Manan.
  Other members of the MCC governing body are academics Mohd Azmyl Md Yusof, Gayathri S. Venkiteswaran, Celine Lim and Terence Ooi.
  The Malaysian Media Council Bill 2024, which was passed in the Dewan Rakyat on Feb 26, will allow self-regulation within the local media industry.
  On Friday, Fahmi signed the gazettement of MMC and it officially took effect from yesterday in conjunction with Hawana 2025 celebration.
  Fahmi also announced the extension of social security protection to part-time and freelance journalists, or stringers.
  He said this was in collaboration with the Social Security Organisation (PERKESO) under the Self-Employment Social Security Scheme.
  “Last year, a total of 531 stringers benefited from the scheme.
  “Similar benefits would be extended this year with an allocation of RM37,170,” he added.
  He also announced that protection of media stringers would also be expanded under the Employees Provident Fund’s i-Saraan scheme.
  He also announced that over 12,000 journalists would be able to enjoy one-off 50% discounts on AirAsia flights to over 50 destinations in Asean, in conjunction with Malaysia’s chairmanship.
  Fahmi also revealed that AirAsia was keen to name one of its airplanes after a journalist with special livery to honour media practitioners. 
  
------------------------------
PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian Media Council (MMC) has been formed and the Act governing it has come into effect, but the debates on its role as a regulator or protector of media continue. 
  In a forum session titled “Malaysian Media Council: Regulator or Media Protector?”, held in conjunction with National Journalists Day (Hawana) 2025, panellists discussed how the newly-formed council will govern the local media landscape, the threats from technology and artificial intelligence and how newsrooms will have to evolve with it, among many issues. 
  Premesh Chandran, chairman of the pro-tem committee of the MMC, said the council will not only serve as a regulator but will also be a key support system for agencies and practitioners, which also safeguards the industry.
  He said industry players should view the council’s framework as a strategic collaboration.
  “You need to look at media regulations as a form of strategic and regulatory collaboration because you have so many players,” he said. 
  “You can’t look at the media council in isolation. What you have to look at is how is the regulatory collaboration going to happen across organisations, and that is the key challenge we face,” he added.
  Premesh noted that the MMC is a very young organisation, with its trust, strength and  institutional capabilities having yet to be built. 
  “It has to be built by the industry and all those who want to build the council.
  “It is not going to be a solution on Day 1, but it provides the regulatory room for us to innovate given the technology and other changes that are pushing the industry forward.”
  He said the council has to understand the trends and discuss with its regulatory partners on how to shape the media regulatory environment as a whole.
  Academic Prof Datuk Dr Ahmad Murad Merican questioned why there was no provision of ethics in the Bill that was tabled. 
  “I’m quite disappointed with the Act because there’s no provision for ethics because when it goes to Parliament, the code of conduct must be integral in the Act,” said the professor at International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilisation (ISTAC-IIUM).
  In response, Premesh said this was because the Attorney General Chambers  had said during the process of drafting the Bill that ethical codes were a live document that needed change over time. Therefore, amending it would require it to be brought to Parliament.
  “It’s not something that should be set in law.
  “Therefore, the conclusion was to include, in the Bill, the function of the council is to create standards and implement it,” he said.
  Meanwhile, The Star’s  senior news editor Datuk Philip Golingai questioned if organisations outside the purview of MMC would be regulated, as the mainstream media would be regulated. 
  He said this in view of the proliferation of online news sources, some of which were not adhering to ethical reporting standards.
  “What would happen to those who are not in the MMC? Do we regulate them as well?” he said.
  “On safeguarding media freedom, I think that question is tricky. Yes, MMC is there but I don’t think it can protect the media because there are political interferences on both sides, there are also litigation where we can get sued and we are not protected by the MMC. And then there is also harassment and things like that,” he said. 
  Premesh said that to address the issue, there should be a form of incentive to encourage participation of media entities in the council and follow its stipulated news standard.
  “For example, the government can commit and say that it will only advertise with the media organisation when it becomes a member of the council or even provides training opportunities,” he added.
  Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ) Malaysia executive director Wathshlah Naidu said the MMC’s roles go beyond becoming the guardian of the media landscape, but also as a catalyst for better journalism practice and standards.
  “The role should also not be limited to defining ethical standards or code of conduct but also what message it will give to the public.
  “Reaching out to the public will be a critical challenge while empowering the media and meeting technological demands,” she said.
  In a question-and-answer session later, Premesh said that the MMC is also looking into working with the Human Resources Development Corporation (HRDCorp) to provide training and development for journalists.
  “The idea is to have a skills framework accredited by HRDCorp, so that journalists could undertake the necessary training and qualifications,” he said.
  Themed “Journalism in the New Era: Embracing AI, Safeguarding Ethics”, Hawana 2025 is organised by the Communications Ministry through Bernama as the implementing agency.

From Clement Stanley
On June 5, former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad launched a secretariat committee as a “big umbrella” to “save the Malays” by addressing issues affecting the community.
So much for the “Bangsa Malaysia” policy he once introduced during his first stint as prime minister.
While Mahathir may have forgotten the said concept, East Malaysia hasn’t.
Sabah and Sarawak are already practising an all encompassing people-led government that continues to focus on the eradication of poverty and better infrastructure development for everybody regardless of race and religion.
In Sabah and Sarawak, the state leaders do not put emphasis on a single race. That is why our state governments are made up of people of all races.
This is also why Mahathir’s successors have espoused slogans such as 1Malaysia or Keluarga Malaysia, because they too saw the importance of unity in this nation that is made up of people of different races. They, too, saw the need for a “Bangsa Malaysia”.
Still, Mahathir’s new initiative begs us to question if he is implying that the current government is a non-Malay led government? A quick check will show otherwise.
Mahathir had more or less a similar lineup in terms of the racial makeup of his Cabinets. So, what’s wrong with this one?
He oddly laments about there being many groups trying to unite the Malays, but also warns that “if there are too many, we end up split”.
Mahathir seems to think his new group is in no way an addition of yet another cook to an already crowded kitchen. Lest we forget, he had set up other Malay-based parties after quitting Umno.
So, maybe, having too many groups isn’t the problem. Maybe, just maybe, Mahathir wants to be the only head chef in this kitchen.

THE Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation (APU) has once again proven its excellence in the field of cybersecurity, with its students sweeping the top three positions at the Universiti Malaya Cybersecurity Summit (UMCS) Capture the Flag (CTF) Finals 2025, held from May 17 to 18.
  CTF in cybersecurity is an exercise in which participants attempt to find text strings, called “flags”, which are secretly hidden within purposefully vulnerable programs or websites. These simulations are designed to test participants’ technical skills, critical thinking and problem-solving under pressure.
  The competition, held at the Pusat Asasi Sains of UM in Kuala Lumpur, brought together some of the brightest minds in cybersecurity from across the country. It featured a wide spectrum of challenges, including forensics, blockchain, web exploitation, binary exploitation and reverse engineering.
  APU’s exceptional performance at the event reflected its robust academic foundation, hands-on learning approach and strong industry-aligned training. These elements contribute to shaping future-ready professionals equipped with practical expertise and analytical rigour.
  Crowned champion, Team C0UGH1NGB4BY comprised students Lee Kuang Weng, Wong Wei Jie, Hong Rui Yi and Ruhan Aidan Amaradasa. They led the scoreboard with an impressive 6,178 points, showcasing top-tier technical skills and collaborative problem-solving throughout the attack- and defence-style competition.
  First runner-up honours went to Team Squad Buster, comprising Lee Juen Jiet, Lim Jin Wei, Tan Nick Kean and Jeremy Phang Kah Chun, who secured a solid 6,043 points.
  Meanwhile, Team Formal Sweatpants – Shunsuke Tan Hei, Lim Shi Han and Leong Han Ming – achieved second runner-up with 5,286 points, completing the clean sweep for APU.
  All three teams are enrolled in the Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science (Cyber Security) programme and are active committee members of APU’s Forensic and Cybersecurity Research Centre – Student Section (FSEC-SS).
  Tech brilliance 
  The students’ path to victory began with a preliminary Jeopardy-style round held from April 7 to 13, in which seven APU teams competed.
  Five of those teams qualified for the finals, which featured a highly challenging attack and defence format.
  In addition to the winning teams, Team Pusumrifa ranked seventh with 3,131 points and Team Fresh Hasher finished 24th with 1,650 points.
  Other APU teams in the qualifiers included “just4fun” and “F1R3B0YZ”.
  The competition was organised by Persatuan Komputer UM and co-organised by the Google Developer Group, with key industry support from Re:Hack, a cybersecurity consultancy known for its focus on vulnerability research and community outreach.
  Industry exposure 
  The UMCS CTF Finals 2025 not only served as a battleground for cybersecurity challenges but also as a meaningful platform for students to engage with industry experts, network with peers and receive mentorship from leading practitioners in the field.
  This achievement is especially significant as many of the APU participants are also involved in organising APU’s own flagship event – the upcoming Battle of Hackers competition – further underlining their commitment to cybersecurity excellence both in and out of the classroom.
  Mentorship 
  This success story could not have been written without the guidance and dedication of APU’s academic mentors.
  The students were coached and supported by School of Technology (SoT) senior lecturers Nor Azlina Abd Rahman and Noris Ismail, along with SoT senior head Assoc Prof Dr Thang Ka Fei.
  Their combined efforts in fostering a hands-on, research-driven and industry-relevant learning ecosystem have played a pivotal role in nurturing the next generation of cyber professionals.
  Thang said, “This achievement speaks volumes about the calibre of our students and the strength of our cybersecurity curriculum.
  “At APU, we are committed to cultivating not just academic excellence but also real-world capabilities.
  “These results reaffirm our standing as a leading institution in producing highly skilled, industry-ready cybersecurity professionals who are prepared to take on the evolving digital landscape.”
  With consistent wins and growing industry recognition, APU continues to lead the charge in developing cyber talent for the future.

Parhizkar siblings, Mohammad Parsa, 12, and Mohammad Rohan, nine, from SK Putrajaya Presint 8(1), are proof of Malaysia’s potential to cultivate young digital talents who build with purpose.
  The pupils emerged as winners of the Best Young Inventor Excellence Award (Primary Level) at the annual International Invention, Innovation and Technology Exhibition (ITEX) 2025, beating 144 participants from 55 schools nationwide.
  They also clinched the Gold Medal in the World Young Inventors Exhibition (WYIE) category.
  Held in Kuala Lumpur from May 29 to 31, the event featured the brothers’ innovative project – Minedu AI, an intelligent Minecraft learning assistant that seamlessly integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into Minecraft to transform the game into a powerful educational platform aligned with Malaysia’s primary school syllabus.
  This invention empowers pupils to learn science, biology, geography, and more – through interactive AI-driven gameplay.
  Backed by Google Malaysia as a technology partner, the brothers went beyond just inventing – they launched their own startup, making them among the youngest co-founders in the country.
  Their solution has already begun generating income through plugin licensing and AI training workshops for pupils.
  “We love Minecraft and wanted to make learning fun, not boring,” said Mohammad Rohan, while Mohammad Parsa added, “With AI, we can help every child learn better while enjoying the game they already love.”
  Their plugin observes player actions in-game and uses a chatbot to teach and test pupils through real-time, personalised feedback. It’s currently being deployed in pilot projects at schools exploring edtech innovation.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -Formula One leader Oscar Piastri stayed hopeful after a qualifying session that had McLaren boss Andrea Stella talking of damage limitation in Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix.
  The Australian will start from third on the grid with teammate Lando Norris, 10 points behind in the standings after nine of 24 races, back in seventh.
  Mercedes' George Russell took pole position and Red Bull's Max Verstappen, winner for the past three years, joined him on the front row in a repeat of 2024's qualifying top two at Montreal's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.
  "Our pace on race days is generally where we’re strong," Piastri, winner of five races this season and bidding to become the first Australian to take six in a single campaign, told a news conference. 
  "These two next to me were very quick in the race runs yesterday, so it’s certainly not going to be a slam dunk win, but I think we’re definitely in the fight."
  The session, a gift for those talking up bad blood between Russell and Verstappen after a headline clash in Spain between the pair, left McLaren off the pace for once in a scrappy session.
  It was the first time Mercedes had taken pole this season.
  "The picture changes completely for the race, that's what we have to focus on," Stella told Sky Sports television.
  "I think in terms of race pace we should be a bit more comfortable but let's see. This weekend could be one of damage limitation."
  Norris will certainly have a battle on his hands to get onto the podium.
  "(I made) a couple of big mistakes, one hitting the wall on the last lap on the exit of turn seven and also the first lap at the final corner. Mistakes that cost me," he said.
  "We have not been as quick as usual, and it was maybe not the car to take pole position, but it should have been enough for the top three.
  "It is a very easy track to push 1% too much, and pay the price, and that’s what happened today. A podium will be tough because we don’t have the pace we have had of the past few races."

Following an exciting week of data and sample collection at the Al-Sultan Abdullah Royal Tiger Reserve, Pahang, a team of multidisciplinary researchers is now working on a scientific report to shape long-term conservation strategies, contribute to the reserve’s biodiversity inventory, and support efforts to protect the state’s natural heritage.
  Fourteen research teams comprising 60 scientists, mountain guides and field staff took part in the scientific expedition, a press release dated May 20 read.
  The expedition – which saw the group navigating the peak of Gunung Aais, wading through the rocky riverbed of Sungai Tembeling and its tributaries, and trekking across steep terrain – was the first of its kind to the newly gazetted reserve.
  Exciting finds: (Left) The group posing for a photo at the end of the scientific expedition. (Right) Researcher Dr Nurul ‘Ain Elias measuring bat species with the assistance of a team member from FRIM. – Photo by Ryan Peters
  Preliminary findings have scientists excited about the possibility of confirming rare species of flora and fauna within the 331,573-acre protected area.
  Led by The Habitat Foundation (THF) programme director Dr Ahmad Zafir Abdul Wahab, the researchers – from institutions including Universiti Sains Malaysia, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, Universiti Malaya, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, and Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM) – studied everything from geology, fungi, mosses and plants to freshwater fish, bats, small mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects and spiders.
  “We had a very successful expedition – it was a true collaboration between the scientific and local community for the common goal of conservation.
  “Every night, our local guides listened intently to the scientific sharing sessions, full of excitement for what might be discovered the next morning.
  “Through this joint effort, we have recorded species not found on record for many years, species potentially new to science, and an array of biodiversity that shows how special the Al-Sultan Abdullah Royal Tiger Reserve is,” said Ahmad Zafir.
  These findings are part of a joint effort between the Pahang State Parks Corporation and Enggang Management Services to establish a comprehensive biodiversity baseline for the reserve.
  The research initiative, funded by the European Union, was also supported by implementing partners Bringing Back Our Rare Animals, Nature Based Solutions, Panthera and THF.

ALOR GAJAH: Trade unions in Melaka have been urged to take a more proactive role to protect the welfare of their members in various sectors by leveraging initiatives and programmes available at both the federal and state levels.
  Chief Minister Datuk Seri Ab Rauf Yusoh said at the same time, workers are encouraged to join unions registered under the Trade Union Affairs Department (JHEKS), noting that this will help ensure their voices are heard and their rights protected under the Trade Union Act 1959.
  “Joining a union is a personal choice, but it is the union that safeguards workers’ rights – rights that individuals may not always be aware of.
  “By becoming members, workers gain access to protection and a second opinion before any action is taken.
  “As for the trade unions, I hope they will continue to play an effective role in protecting the welfare of their members,” he told Bernama at a press conference after officiating the JHEKS Corporate Social Responsibility programme with the community at Villa d’Acqua, Kampung Pulau, here yesterday.
  Also present were representative of the Human Resources Ministry Dr Kelvin Yii Lee Wuen, state health, human resources and unity committee chairman Datuk Ngwe Hee Sem, and JHEKS director-general Mohd Asri Abdul Wahab.
  Ab Rauf said to date, 28 main trade unions and 41 branches in the state are registered under JHEKS, representing more than 60,000 members.
  Earlier, 21 trade unions in Melaka had their applications approved and will receive grant assistance amounting to RM359,998 under the Union Affairs Development Grant.

拉菲兹的离开，其实不只是个人选择，更像一面镜子，照出了执政团队的失落与偏离。
安华三度延长反贪会主席阿占巴基任期，反贪机构和司法体系还剩下多少独立性，赵明福案件更像一根横亘在改革路上的刺，始终未能得到圆满交代。台上还有多少人，仍然坚守着当初上台时的改革承诺？
当改革让位于利益平衡，当官员习惯为失误找借口，改革派的失望也越来越深。拉菲兹或许已经看见，这届政府在改革的路上，步伐愈发踟蹰，方向越来越模糊。
他的离开，背后承载着厚重的理想主义。年轻时，他投身“烈火莫熄”运动，放弃高薪工作，毅然投入政治。他揭发金融丑闻、创办政策研究机构，以实际行动推动廉政改革。他的专业能力与理性改革思路，曾被寄望能带领国家走上一条新路。
然而，党选败给安华女儿努鲁依莎，成为压倒他的最后一根稻草。眼看
公正党
逐渐家族化，他或许对当下的政治现实非常失望。
即便如此，拉菲兹仍强调，自己不会放弃追求美好马来西亚的理想。卸下部长职务后，他可以非官职身份，继续发声，摆脱那些让他失望的权力游戏和束缚，更自由地针对各种议题畅所欲言。
或许对拉菲兹来说，真正的政治，不执着于朝夕得失，而在于能否留下千秋之业。
拉菲兹的离开，留给安华政府的，远不止少了一名部长，而是一道无声的提醒：安华团队的改革初心，还在吗？

当改革让位于利益平衡，当官员习惯为失误找借口，改革派的失望也越来越深。拉菲兹或许已经看见，这届政府在改革的路上，步伐愈发踟蹰，方向越来越模糊。
首相安华于6月12日（星期四）表示希望辞官的经济部长拉菲兹与天然资源及环境永续部长聂纳兹米，可以继续留在内阁。

ADVERTISEMENT

但在隔天6月13日（星期五），拉菲兹在脸书发文说，那天是他最后一次走进经济部办公室，处理最后的事务，并收拾办公室。
看着他最后一次走进经济部的贴文，不禁让人唏嘘。他所带领的5名精英，个个都是马来西亚未来的希望。但如今，这五名精英将随着他的离去，一同告别经济部，回到各自岗位。

部长职是很多政治人物梦寐以求的高位，背后有资源、利益、权力与荣誉，更有实现理想的舞台。但拉菲兹却坚定拒绝安华的挽留。或许，他在权力核心里，已经看见了理想主义者无法接受的现实。

他看来反而松了一大口气，终于可以远离那些权力走廊里的种种伎俩与算计。


在这届团结政府中，为了维持政权稳定，各党派之间犬牙交错，权力运作逐渐沦为利益分配的游戏。安抚盟友、分配官位，成了日常政治的惯例，执政方向也渐渐失去了原则。

他说，有人指这些人年纪大了，他给予同情，但也请这些人将人民的钱给回国家，不然他如何维修学校？
“我以前曾说过，你踢我、打我到半死、囚禁我、侮辱我和我的家人，都算了。现在我是首相，我原谅这一切，但你偷走我的国家和人民的财产，这不是我的，你必须给回，不管是谁，我都要索回。”

曾繁翀（右六）颁赠纪念品给大会议长陈宝光。右三为郭运兰。（曾繁翀提供）
（古来15日讯）马华古来区会三机构昨天举行代表大会并通过4项议案，其中一项是要求党中央及国阵，在国会解散时终止与希盟的合作关系，来届柔佛州选和全国大选在不与行动党合作的情况下，以国阵旗帜上阵，免成团结政府施政失败的牺牲品。
区会主席曾繁翀今日发文告表示，近期的MyKiosk销售亭、津贴煤气、“A-不等于A”以及扩大销售与服务税（SST）征收等课题皆引发民怨，若与希盟继续合作，对马华和国家都不会是好事。
ADVERTISEMENT
“没有希盟的柔佛州政府有杰出的表现，就是一个很好的例子。”
他认为，目前马华遇到的最大瓶颈，就是在一个不断榨压人民的团结政府中，默默成为失败政策的代罪羔羊。
他指出，马华对政策提出抗议，为人民发声，却一再被攻击，包括党员制作短片来抨击政府的不良政策，都被政府打压。
“昨天，马青彭亨州分团团长黄绍敏在网络上引述其他媒体报道的课题进行评论而被举报，必须到警察局录口供。对于这种对不同言论的打压，就像白色恐怖，对民主政治是一个大倒车。”
他也针对早前古来县华人村长调任风波指出，他一直抱持开放与开通的心态，等待上层领导的各种商议，惟最终的要求不被接纳，这对地方上有欠公平的安排，令他感到失望及遗憾。
他强调，如同去年大会的提案，区会始终坚持立场，要求在来届州选上阵竞选武吉峇都州议席。
古来区会妇女组主席郭运兰也补充，她强烈反对党领袖在没有充分听取基层意见的情况下，擅自委派村长人选。
她希望党高层能重视“新港新村-我们已有适合的推存村长人选”的诉求，而不是让村长人选被压制、被剥夺为群众服务的机会，这不仅打击基层的积极性，也严重损害党在民众心目中的形象。
出席代表大会者，包括马青总团代表兼柔佛州分团团长邢智立、马华古来区会秘书黄宝前及马青古来区团团长何凯威等。
当天的大会议长为区会顾问陈宝光，所通过的另外3项提案：
1. 要求联邦政府及内阁关注人民的诉求，不要在全球经济充满挑战的时候一意孤行建议涨电费、削减燃油等各项补贴和扩大SST范围等，造成物价高涨。
2. 强烈要求教育部纠正“A-不等于A”的政策，以免更多优秀生在这个突如其来的通令下被无辜牺牲。
3. 全力支持柔佛国阵州政府招商引资的各项努力。

此外，SST调整并非单一因素。接下来的几个月，我国经济还将面对一系列可能推升通胀预期的政策变化，例如7月即将生效的电费调涨、渐进全面实施的电子发票制度、以及下半年即将推行的RON95汽油针对性补贴制度。这些因素叠加之下，不仅将提高企业经营成本，也可能削弱消费信心，加剧市场对未来价格上行的预期，进而造成实际的通胀压力。简而言之，即使SST扩大政策表面上看似“有选择性”地征税，但在一个高度交织的经济体系中，没有人能完全置身事外。价格的上涨不仅影响被征税商品的消费者，更会在经济链条中层层传导，最终影响整个市场，甚至对中长期经济增长和社会民生带来深远影响。
那么，当前是否为扩大和调整销售与服务税（SST）税基的合适时机？从理论上看，许多人或许会认为现在正是推行该项措施的“窗口期”——毕竟大马的
通胀率
近期持续维持在较低水平。数据显示，2024年3月与4月的通胀率均维持在1.4%左右，属于相对温和的通胀环境。在这种背景下扩大税基，理论上可以在不引发过度物价上涨的情况下，为政府创造额外财政收入。
然而，这种理论前提是经济处于稳健，消费与投资活跃，市场信心充足的状态下。但实际情况远非如此。当前的大马经济环境正处于不确定中前行。通胀率维持低位，背后可能并非经济健康的信号，反而可能反映内需疲弱、消费力放缓的隐忧。
更令人担忧的是，全球经济正面临严峻挑战。美国加征关税政策带来的不确定性，将直接冲击我国对外出口，加剧我国出口疲弱的风险。在全球需求放缓、外部市场趋冷的情况下，大马将难以依赖出口作为短期内的增长引擎。此时，唯有依靠内需，尤其是私人消费，才能稳定经济基本盘，发挥“压舱石”的作用。
然而，就在这个关键时刻，国内经济支柱企业也出现隐忧。国家石油公司（Petronas）因盈利下滑，计划大幅裁员及冻结招聘，而雇员公积金局（EPF）2025年首季的投资回酬亦出现下跌，同比减少13%。它们不仅是国家的战略性机构，其动向也往往反映整个宏观经济的脉络。它们所面对的盈利压力和调整举措，极可能削弱就业市场与投资情绪，进一步影响民间消费能力。
在这多重内外压力叠加的背景下，贸然扩大SST税基，不仅将推升成本与价格预期，也有可能削弱消费者信心，抑制原本已显脆弱的内需表现。这将削弱我国抵御全球经济下行风险的“最后一道防线”。因此，此时此刻扩大与调整SST税制，时机显然并不理想。与其急于通过增加税收来弥补财政空间，不如暂缓相关措施，优先稳住国内消费力，激励内需，为接下来可能面临的全球经济风暴提供更坚实的缓冲。唯有如此，才能确保国家经济在外部动荡中维持一定的韧性与增长潜力。
综上所述，政府此次扩大与调整SST税制的根本动因，主要是出于财政压力，以及落实2023年公共财政与财政责任法下的目标——即将财政赤字压低至3.8%，并将国家债务占GDP的比率控制在60%以内。政策方向虽有其逻辑基础，但任何财政政策的设计与执行，必须结合现实经济环境，因时而动、因势而变，不能一味为了达成长期财政目标而忽视短期经济稳定的需要。政府在2025年财政预算案中确实早已提出扩大税基的计划，但当时并未预见到美国关税政策变化所带来的全球经济不确定性，也未预料国际市场需求将明显放缓。当前情况下，我国更应优先保障国内消费力，强化内需作为经济增长的支柱，以稳固整体经济的基本面，而非在内外部不利因素交叠之际推行可能抑制消费信心的税制改革。
在财政紧张的现实下，政府不妨优先从“节流”着手，例如检讨与暂缓部分非关键的公共开支与发展项目，以缓解短期财政压力。这种做法不仅可避免对消费市场造成负面冲击，也更贴近当前的宏观经济节奏。考虑到美元走弱及全球经济衰退的趋势，即使我国在短期内未能显著压低财政赤字，对马币汇率的负面影响也有限。比起过度强调赤字目标，更应关注如何稳住经济基本盘，提振市场信心，确保人民生活成本不过快上升，才能在全球风浪之中稳住国家经济航向。

高庭在尤索夫案宣判控方提交的证据无法在表面上定罪。意思就是，在控方提呈的证据与证人，经过控辩双方的来回盘问之后，如果被告选择沉默，法庭还是不认为证据足以证明被告有罪。换句话说，控方提出的证据薄弱。
问题的关键是，到底控方，即总检察署，如何衡量手上的证据是否足够？总检察署必须检讨，为何当初没有要求警方加强调查、收集和提供更多的证据，以强化他们控告涉案者？到底有多少宗案件就是因为这样而让被告当庭释放？
一名专业的检察官在处理一宗刑事调查案件时，不管案件严重与否，或者是涉及的人事物复杂与否，该案件的档案一般来回总检察署和调查单位好几回。原因是总检察署一开始未必满意警方的调查素质、方向和速度，例如总检察署认为他们如果要提控某人，他们可能还缺乏一些重要或关键证据。这些证据或许对他们来说是非常重要的。
总检察长多次表明，联邦宪法和
刑事程序法典
也有规定：决定是否要提控某人，依靠的是调查机构，如警察、反贪会等所提呈的证据。此外，总检察署有载量权决定以什么法令，在哪一个法庭决定要提控某人。最后，总检察署也有权力决定是否要终止提控某人。
和尤索夫案一样，在赵明福案，总检察长必须解释为何他认为证据不足，无法控告相关的涉案人士？到底警方的调查报告显示了什么？像这样备受瞩目的案件，虽然总检察长在公函中解释为何做出“没有进一步行动”（NFA）的决定，但是如果一日不公开调查报告，公众的疑虑一日都不会消除。
这不只是赵明福案件，包括消防员
莫哈末阿迪
因公殉职一案也是如此。事到如今，关键的已经不是为何总检察署没有控告相关人士，而是到底执法单位怎样调查这些案件？我的看法是，现在最能够解除公众疑虑的就是公开执法单位的调查报告。

总检察署是否享有绝对权力决定提控某人？答案：是！既然如此，总检察署以什么标准来衡量？答案：证据的多寡，以及证据的含金量。可惜的是，我们并没有任何仪器或方程式可以进行这方面的数字计算。
好的证据就是直接证据，那就是能够完完全全证明这个刑事案就是涉嫌者所干的，没有他人。如果有这样的证据，而且数量甚多，那么总检察署几乎肯定可以立案，因为涉嫌者入罪的机率可能超过90%。

这时涉案者将会成为被告。被告的辩护律师为了要协助被告脱罪，必须卯足全力挑战总检察署提出的证据，质疑证据的合理性，尽力挑起合理的疑点。如果总检察署从警方得来的证据固若金汤，那么辩护律师就无法挑起任何合理疑点。

吉隆坡高庭在6月12日针对首相安华前助理尤索夫贩毒和持有假枪（本文称“尤索夫案”）案裁决表罪不成立，当庭释放。承审法官裁定，检方未能出示可靠证据，以证实上述两项控罪的所有构成要素。

其实，这并非中国首次将稀土作为国际谈判筹码。2010年，日本海上保安厅在钓鱼台海域扣押一艘中国渔船及船长，中国除了外交抗议外，亦非正式地暂停对日本的稀土出口。虽然未发布正式禁令，但多家日本企业反映供应中断。事后，日本开始向大马采购稀土，实施来源多元化策略，马来西亚亦因此成为日本稀土进口来源之一。
因此，当美国遭遇与日本当年类似的情况，被中国掐住稀土供应咽喉之际，大马谈判代表团在与美国谈判时，应将重稀土供应列为重要谈判筹码，提醒美方必须退让，并建议美国在大马投资设厂，直接开采与生产本地稀土资源。
当年莱纳斯在大马的初期投资约2亿美元，创造约400个就业机会，每年稀土出口额高达数亿美元。若美国前来设厂，不仅可提升大马经济，更可使大马纳入全球关键矿产产业链，进一步推进成为先进国的目标。
尽管美国政府已与莱纳斯签署在德州兴建新精炼厂的合约，金额高达2.58亿美元，但德州经常面临飓风与洪水等天灾，再加上美国人工成本高昂，将提高生产成本。相比之下，大马是美国实现稀土来源多元化的另一个理想选择。
至于稀土开采与生产所带来的环保课题，大马政府必须从源头开始把关，包括加强环境法规、完善放射性副产物的处理方法，以及推动土地生态修复。这方面应结合本地与国际大学及企业的专业力量。
总而言之，大马在与美国的关税谈判中，绝不能错过这一个战略转机。

IN recognition of her trailblazing research in sustainable engineering, Curtin University Malaysia deputy dean of research and development Assoc Prof Dr Tan Inn Shi has been awarded the Institution of Engineers Malaysia (IEM) Young Engineer Award 2025.
  The award – one of the highest honours for early-career engineers in Malaysia – was presented by IEM president Prof Dr Jeffrey Chiang Choong Luin during the institution’s 66th annual general meeting in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, on April 19.
  Tan, a chemical engineer by training, was celebrated for her groundbreaking work in renewable energy technologies, especially in the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodegradable plastics derived from agricultural waste – advancements that are set to transform two of Malaysia’s most environmentally challenging sectors: aviation and plastics.
  Her SAF research, conducted through Curtin Malaysia’s renewable energy research division, focuses on converting algae and palm biomass into low-emission aviation fuel, a game-changing development that supports Malaysia’s push for carbon neutrality and could redefine the future of flight in the region.
  In parallel, Tan is leading efforts to develop bioplastics from macroalgae biomass waste, offering an eco-friendly alternative to single-use plastics and addressing one of the nation’s most pressing environmental threats: plastic pollution.
  “This award is more than a personal milestone; it is a win for sustainable engineering.
  “Our research bridges academia and industry to tackle real-world problems, from decarbonising air travel to reducing our dependence on petrochemical-based plastics,” she said in a press release dated June 5.
  Congratulating Tan, Curtin Malaysia interim pro-vice-chancellor, president and chief executive Prof Vincent Lee described her work as exemplifying impact-driven, solutions-oriented research.
  “The recognition by IEM is a proud moment for the university and a strong signal of Sarawak’s growing leadership in green technology,” he said.
  The IEM Young Engineer Award recognises outstanding engineers under 40 who have made significant contributions to the profession through technical excellence, innovation and societal impact.
  Tan’s recognition places her among the country’s most promising engineering minds and highlights the critical role of research institutions in driving Malaysia’s sustainability agenda.
  With this national recognition, Tan expressed hope of inspiring more young engineers – especially women – to pursue careers at the forefront of sustainability science.

PETALING JAYA: There is no evidence that suggests mechanical failure is the cause of the bus crash near Gerik, Perak, on Monday that killed 15 Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI) students, reveals a preliminary Puspakom report.
  The preliminary technical report revealed that physical inspections on the brakes, brake lining and brake drums were in satisfactory condition, with no signs of excessive wear.
  The chartered bus overturned after colliding with a multi-­purpose vehicle (MPV) on the East-West Highway, leaving 33 others injured, including the bus driver, his assistant, as well as the family of four in the MPV.
  The bus driver, who has since been charged in court, previously claimed that the bus suffered brake failure during the incident.
  The technical report which was released yesterday also stated that inspections on the air compressor tank also did not detect any leakages.
  It said the tyres were also found to be in satisfactory condition and complied with Road Transport Department specifications.
  Additionally, the steering and suspensions were also found to be in satisfactory condition.
  “However, the leaf spring and shock absorbers misaligned from their original positions, possibly due to the accident,” it said.
  Based on observations and technical findings, the report said there was no evidence that mechanical system failure caused the accident.
  “There is a high chance it resul­ted from factors like road conditions, human factors and more,” read the report that was prepared based on information from vehicle inspection checks before the accident, and also the condition of wreckage, focusing on the brake, steering and suspension systems, and tyres.
  The bus passed its inspection at Puspakom’s branch in Kota Baru, Kelantan, on April 13 with its next inspection scheduled for Oct 21.
  The bus, which has been inspected 24 times since 2013, had failed checks twice – once in 2015 and another in 2023.
  In a statement, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said the necessary improvement measures would be considered and implemented once the final report was received.
  “The safety of road users is our priority. The ministry conveys its condolences to the victims’ families and expresses its commitment to ensure justice is served while ensuring such tragedies do not repeat,” he said yesterday.
  Meanwhile, seven injured victims of the crash are still undergoing treatment in government hospitals.
  Acting Gerik police chief DSP Muhammad Firdaus Abdullah said four of them were UPSI students, with two of them at Hospital Taiping and the other two at Hospital Raja Permaisuri Bainun here.
  “The other three, comprising a woman and two children, are passengers in the MPV.
  “They are receiving treatment at Hospital Baling in Kedah,” he said when contacted by Bernama yesterday.
  The bus carrying 42 UPSI students was travelling from Jertih, Terengganu, to the university’s main campus at Tanjung Malim, Perak, when it collided with the MPV at KM53 of the East-West Highway.
  Thirteen students died at the scene, while two others were pronounced dead at the hospital.
  
------------------------------
Nahas tragik melibatkan pelajar Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI) baru-baru ini amat menyayat hati dan pada masa sama menimbulkan kemarahan banyak pihak yang melihat Malaysia masih gagal menangani masalah keselamatan bas.
  Walaupun fokus kepada masalah keselamatan jalan raya ni amat ketara dan membuak apabila berlaku nahas bas yang melibatkan kematian yang tinggi, sebenarnya setiap hari secara purata 16 hingga18 orang menjadi mangsa dan telah hilang nyawa di atas jalan raya.
  Inilah situasi keselamatan jalan raya Malaysia. Kita masih belum dapat mengubah tren peningkatan kemalangan dan kematian akibat nahas jalan raya. Hanya semasa Covid-19 sahaja, Malaysia melihat penurunan signifikan dalam tempoh 20 tahun lepas.
  Setiap kali kemalangan berprofil tinggi berlaku, pelbagai pihak memberi saranan dan pihak bertanggungjawab menyatakan keputusan dan tindakan yang diperlukan.
  Jika diteliti, ada juga saranan berulang. Ini menunjukkan sama ada: keputusan dibuat terdahulu tidak dilaksanakan; dilakukan tetapi tidak berkesan; ataupun tidak wujud keupayaan untuk memastikan kelestarian impak positif yang dihajati.
  Mari kita kupas kemalangan bas di Grik minggu lepas menggunakan pendekatan Sistem Selamat dan kemudian akan diketengahkan cadangan yang wajar diambil untuk memberi nafas baharu dalam memberi perubahan tren positif terhadap prestasi keselamatan jalan raya Malaysia
  Apa yang diketahui mengenai kemalangan ini? Sebuah bas hilang kawalan dan akibatnya rebah ke sisi kiri bas. Akibatnya 15 mangsa kehilangan nyawa dan ramai lagi yang cedera.
  Mengapa bas hilang kawalan? Lazimnya aktiviti rekonstruksi kemalangan akan dilakukan oleh pakar dan akan cuba menganggar konfigurasi nahas sebelum dan selepas insiden. Walaupun pengiraan dan anggaran selalu menggunakan bukti fizikal dan pemodelan dinamika pelanggaran, dalam hal ini, sebuah video yang menggambarkan insiden itu wujud dan dikongsi luas di media sosial.
  Kita boleh lihat bas itu memotong pada kelajuan tinggi di selekoh dan kemungkinan situasi turun bukit dan hasilnya terus hilang kawalan dan terseret, melanggar penghadang jalan dan akhirnya rebah ke sisi kiri.
  Mengapa bas memotong pada kelajuan tinggi di kawasan berbahaya? Adakah faktor kenderaan, atau faktor manusia atau gabungan kedua-duanya? Adakah faktor jalan juga mempunyai peranan? Pendekatan sistem selamat diperlukan untuk memahami persoalan ini dan yang lebih penting untuk mencari penyelesaian berkesan.
  Dari perspektif kenderaan, bagaimana keadaan bas: Adakah bas dalam keadaan baik dan selamat untuk membuat perjalanan jauh di kawasan yang mempunyai risiko di jalan raya? Ini termasuk, keadaan tayar, brek dan lain-lain. Siapa yang memastikan bas ini selamat setiap kali sebelum perjalanan bermula? Pemandu? Syarikat bas? Atau pihak berkuasa yang bertanggungjawab.
  Dari perspektif manusia: Adakah pemandu kompeten, dan mempunyai ciri-ciri yang memahami risiko dan meletakkan keselamatan penumpang sebagai keutamaan. Mematuhi had kelajuan, pastikan tidak mengantuk, dan aspek pemanduan selamat sentiasa diutamakan. Siapa yang akan pastikan pemandu menepati ciri keselamatan yang diperlukan. Syarikat, industri bas ataupun pihak berkuasa yang bertanggungjawab?
  Dari perspektif jalan dan infrastruktur: Adakah jalan di kawasan berisiko tinggi seperti lokasi nahas ini direka bentuk dan disenggara dengan baik untuk memastikan ia selamat dan juga memaafkan? Selamat supaya risiko di jalan raya dikurangkan, contohnya keadaan permukaan jalan yang dalam keadaan baik supaya tayar mencengkam dan proses membrek berperanan.
  Di sini gabungan kenderaan dan jalan berperanan. Cukupkah intervensi seperti garisan berkembar, papan had laju, perabot jalan lain yang membantu mengurangkan kelajuan dan memberi peringatan?
  Semua persoalan di atas menunjukkan keselamatan jalan raya adalah gabungan satu sistem kompleks yang saling memberi kesan antara satu sama lain. Inilah sebabnya mengapa penyelesaian masalah keselamatan jalan raya memerlukan pendekatan ‘Sistem Selamat’ dan tidak boleh dilaksanakan secara terpisah dalam silo yang wujud akibat sistem organisasi yang terpisah.
  Penyelesaiannya memerlukan governan yang cekap dan berkesan. Sistem tadbir urus yang diperlukan ini memerlukan semua komponen dalam sebuah sistem selamat melihat peranan masing-masing dan berfikir sebagai satu sistem yang berintegrasi, tanpa memikirkan isu populariti, isu KPI atau keperluan lain yang sering memasukkan kita dalam silo.
  Mari kita senaraikan siapa pemain utama dalam situasi sistem selamat ini antaranya Kementerian Pengangkutan, Agensi Pengangkutan Awam Darat, Polis , Jabatan Kerja Raya, pihak konsesi jalan sebagai tuan punya jalan, syarikat bas dan industri bas, penumpang dan pengguna, pihak yang bertanggungjawab untuk perancangan kewangan dan sumber negara dan pihak yang bertanggungjawab untuk menyediakan sumber manusia yang mencukupi dan kompeten untuk industri bas.
  Pendapat saya, semua pihak di atas perlu menilai keberkesanan peranan masing-masing dan bagaimana pendekatan sistem selamat betul-betul dilaksanakan. Setiap nyawa yang hilang dan setiap kesengsaraan menjadi penanda kepada kegagalan salah satu dari pemain di atas.
  Oleh itu sebagai penutup, berikut adalah rumusan yang boleh dibuat:
  1.Setiap nahas jalan raya sebenarnya bukan sahaja satu kemalangan, tetapi adalah hasil kepada kegagalan entiti entiti dalam sistem selamat. Ini bermakna ia perlu diurus dengan lebih baik supaya kebarangkalian kemalangan berlaku boleh dikurangkan dan akibat nahas dapat dikurangkan keseriusannya
  2.Pendekatan pengurusan keselamatan jalan raya benar benar memerlukan “the whole of nation approach” dan Malaysia perlu mencari formula baharu kerana jelas pendekatan amalan semasa telah gagal
  3.Aspek governan, tadbir urus dan tata kelola perlu dilihat secara menyeluruh. Perlu ada peneraju, tetapi semua pihak perlu bergerak dalam satu pasukan yang bersinergi
  4.Oleh kerana keselamatan jalan raya melibatkan pengguna dan pengendali yang melibatkan manusia, aspek pengurusan kelakuan melalui kerangka perundangan perlu memberi hasil yang dikehendaki. Ini termasuk penguatkuasaan berkesan yang bukan sahaja meliputi aspek di jalan raya tetapi juga hukuman dan insentif.
  Di sini sistem demerit memainkan peranan penting. Pendekatan yang tidak berubah tidak akan menyelesaikan masalah yang sama. Oleh itu, Malaysia perlu mencari kaedah transformatif dalam mengubah tren keselamatan jalan raya semasa.

PETALING JAYA: Although the new Covid-19 variants that are driving the surge in cases is less likely to cause severe illness, health authorities and experts are urging those in the high-risk group to get updated vaccines and boosters, and mask up in crowded spaces.
  They also urge those who are vulnerable – pregnant women, seniors above 60 and individuals with comorbidities – to get free flu jabs provided by the government through the MySejahtera App.
  In a statement, the Health Ministry urged high-risk groups to get their Covid-19 vaccinations to reduce the risk of infection, severe complications or death.
  Based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) influenza surveillance report, the number of influenza cases have risen to a weekly average of above 90 cases per week in May, compared to a weekly average of 80 cases the month before.
  According to KKMNow, Covid-19 cases in the country have also been inching upwards since May 13, which recorded a seven-day average of 129 cases while on May 31, the seven-day average totalled 307.
  Yet, Covid-19 vaccination rates remain low this year with little to no Covid-19 vaccine uptake as of February.

KOTA KINABALU: Sabah has cemented its position as one of Malaysia’s most attractive economic destinations by securing the third highest spot for approved investments with a total of RM10.9bil obtained in the first quarter of 2025, says Datuk Phoong Jin Zhe.
  The Industrial Development and Entrepreneurship Minister said the amount has already surpassed the total investment recorded for 2024, reflecting renewed confidence in Sabah’s growth potential and economic direction.
  “Sabah now ranks just behind Selangor and Kuala Lumpur in terms of total approved investments in Malaysia,” he said, citing the latest figures from the Malaysian Investment Develop­ment Authority.
  Foreign direct investment was the main driver, contributing RM6.6bil or 61%, while domestic direct investment accounted for RM4.29bil or 39%.
  He said this interest from both international and local players signals strong faith in Sabah’s business ecosystem.
  The manufacturing sector emerged as the largest contributor, drawing RM7.3bil in approved investments, which marked the highest in Malaysia for this quarter.
  Of that amount, RM6.59bil (91.3%) came from foreign sources, while RM711mil (9.7%) originated from Malaysia.
  The services sector followed with RM2.83bil, and the primary sector attracted RM757.1mil.
  “These achievements show that Sabah is not just keeping pace, but emerging as a frontrunner in key sectors, supported by our investor-friendly environment and the state government’s strong commitment to driving industrial development,” Phoong said.
  Despite the ongoing global economic uncertainty and geopolitical challenges, Sabah remains a competitive, resilient and trusted destination for capital and enterprise, he added.
  “The state government remains steadfast in its efforts to strengthen the investment ecosystem and continues to welcome both foreign and domestic investors to help realise our vision of a sustainable and inclusive economic future for Sabah,” he said.

KUALA LUMPUR: The body of a pedestrian who had fallen into a river after being hit by a car has been found.
  Kuala Lumpur Traffic Investigation and Enforcement Department (JSPT) chief Asst Comm Mohd Zamzuri Mohd Isa said the body of the man was found at about 7.30am yesterday, around 150m away from the accident site along Jalan Ipoh.
  “The identity of the victim has yet to be determined and the body has been sent to Hospital Kuala Lumpur for a post-mortem,” he said when contacted.
  On Friday, an accident involving two cars led to the collision with the pedestrian.
  At the time of the incident, a car being driven by a 39-year-old Bangladeshi man had collided into the front side of another car.
  “The car driven by the Bangladeshi man then struck a pedestrian before it plunged into the bridge and was caught between concrete structures and iron pipes,” ACP Mohd Zamzuri had said previously.
  The pedestrian was flung into the river due to the crash.
  Investigations also showed that the Bangladeshi driver did not own the car that was being driven and that police were tracing down its real owner for further action.

FOR several weeks Malaysian diplomats were buzzing with speculation about who would be appointed the new ambassador to the United States.
  There was a lot of pure happiness when their former boss, Tan Sri Muhammad Shahrul Ikram Yaakob, was named, receiving his credentials from His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim, the King of Malaysia, early this month.
  The joy at the appointment of this warm, approachable, and seasoned diplomat is understandable.
  Washington DC is one of the few postings with a history of politically appointed ambassadors. But this time one of their own gets to serve the nation.
  “Shahrul Ikram was a very likable boss and accessible to his officers. Always relaxed, and he has a pleasant and easy going demeanour that always puts people at ease,” said one officer.
  Shahrul Ikram joined the diplomatic service in 1988 and, after postings in several countries and a period as Malaysia’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York, he left on a high note as Wisma Putra’s secretary-general in 2022.
  A stint in the US capital is seen as a prestigious assignment because it is the seat of a superpower. It is an important post for many countries, most of which will send their senior diplomats.
  As Shahrul Ikram, 64, prepares to leave for his posting next month, he is well aware of the challenges ahead.
  “The challenge will be to manage expectations. There is that expectation of the country because what has been highlighted in terms of Malaysia-US relations is only tariffs and more tariffs.
  “Our relations with the US are not defined by one issue. If you look at the bilateral ties, they are long-standing, in existence for more than six decades.
  “Apart from trade and investment, we have ties in defence, culture, education, and others.
  “It is a big challenge for me from that perspective to manage the expectations of the government and expectations of the people.
  “There is this expectation that if they send someone with 35 years of experience, this guy can resolve the issue of tariffs, for example,” he told this columnist.
  Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, in a Facebook posting after receiving Shahrul Ikram in Putrajaya last week, said he has instructed the envoy to further strengthen bilateral ties apart from intensifying efforts to attract high quality and high impact foreign investments.
  “I feel humbled by the trust that has been put on my shoulders by the King, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
  “I am a pensioner who has been pulled out of retirement and given such an important job. I am touched,” Shahrul Ikram said, admitting he had been reluctant to accept the job at first due to several personal issues, but those have now been resolved.
  An ambassador’s role in general is to promote and protect the country’s interests, including the welfare of Malaysian citizens abroad. The head of mission must also manage bilateral relations as the bridge between the two countries by having good networking with stakeholders.

  One of Shahrul Ikram’s immediate tasks is to facilitate communications between Putrajaya and Washington. In layman’s terms he is the government’s messenger with Malaysia’s interests always at the back of his mind.
  As the ambassador, he will meet President Donald Trump to present his credentials. But what follows? How do you keep the lines of communication open?
  The new ambassador will need to establish relationships with White House staff, the legislative branches of the US government (Congress and the Senate) and, of course, the State Department.
  “This is one of the things I have to do so that they can understand our position better. At the same time I will also have to make the position of the American government clear to ours,” Shahrul Ikram said.
  There have been high level contacts between the two countries since Trump took over. An Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry delegation will travel to Washington DC next week to resume negotiations over tariffs imposed on Malaysian goods as a follow up to a similar trip in April.
  Anwar met with US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore recently to discuss enhancing defence and maritime cooperation. In April Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan received a phone call from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio during which the two men spoke about various issues, including suitable dates for an Asean-US special summit.
  Anwar personally wrote to Trump seeking his support for the special summit. Malaysia is the Asean Chair this year and has received support from the rest of Asean for the summit to be held.
  Shahrul Ikram said he will try his best to make the summit happen.
  “I am quite confident it can happen but scheduling is another issue. To get the 10 leaders of Asean and availability of President Trump, all parties involved need to work it out,” he said.
  We understand that to date there has been no confirmation from the US about this summit.
  There are also concerns that the current tensions between the US and China are leading to Asean countries realigning themselves with China.
  However, American ambassador to Malaysia Edgard Kagan this week said the United States sees Malaysia as a key partner even as South-East Asia navigates growing engagement with China.
  He said Washington does not see growing ties with China as a threat to its own relationships in the region, and that South-East Asian countries should not be forced to choose sides.
  The region has had to do its fair share of balancing between the competing interests of the superpowers. Malaysia has maintained a consistent stand that we do not want to be a pawn in the superpowers’ rivalry while managing the complexity of regional dynamics.
  For example, the South China Sea is seeing an increasing number of navigation exercises by certain countries, sparking concerns of a potential armed conflict in the area, which is claimed by Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.
  Shahrul Ikram has his work cut out for him in Washington. Bilateral relations are not all about trade and it’s only when we don’t have serious political and security issues in the way that countries can talk about trade and investment.
  When political relations are strained, trade and investment will be affected, although so much in our world today is interrelated and cannot be viewed in isolated terms.
  “I have taken up the job so I have to give it my best. I am excited now, and I take it as a service to the nation.
  “This is out of sincerity, I am doing this for Malaysia,” said Shahrul Ikram.

The government is urgently inspecting all Boeing 787s after a devastating Air India crash that claimed at least 270 lives last week, the aviation minister said, adding that the authorities were investigating all possible causes.
  The aviation regulator on Friday ordered Air India to conduct additional maintenance checks on its Boeing 787-8/9 aircraft equipped with GEnx engines, including assessments of certain take-off parameters, electronic engine control tests and engine fuel-related checks.
  “We have also given the order to do the extended surveillance of the 787 planes. There are 34 in our Indian fleet,” aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu told a media briefing in New Delhi yesterday.
  “Eight have already been inspected and with immediate urgency, all of them are going to be done.”
  Air India operates 33 Boeing 787s, while rival airline IndiGo has one, according to data from Flightradar24.
  The planes, however, have not been grounded, but a source on Friday said the Indian government was considering that as an option.
  Naidu also said the government will look at all possible theories of what led to the crash.

  Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down, Reuters has reported.
  The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Britain’s Gatwick Airport began losing height seconds after take-off on Thursday and erupted in a fireball as it hit buildings below, in what has been the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
  At least 270 bodies have been recovered from the site of the plane crash, Dhaval Gameti, president of the Junior Doctors Association at BJ Medical College, told reporters.
  Only one of the 242 passengers and crew onboard survived while others were killed as the plane struck the medical college’s hostel as it came down.
  The crisis has cast a shadow on Air India, which has for years struggled to rebuild its reputation and revamp its fleet after the Tata Group took over the airline from the Indian government in 2022.
  Tata’s chairman said on Friday the group wants to understand what happened, but “we don’t know right now”.
  Naidu said a government panel was investigating the crash and will issue a report within three months.
  “We are going to improve every necessary thing that is going to come our way, to improve the safety,” he said at the briefing, declining questions from journalists.
  Dozens of anxious family members have been waiting outside an Ahmedabad hospital to collect bodies of loved ones killed in the crash, as doctors were working overtime to gather dental samples from the deceased to run identification checks and DNA profiling.
  Rafiq Abdul Hafiz Memon, who lost four relatives in the incident, said he was not getting any answers from authorities and was “very hassled”.
  “We have lost our children ... we are not understanding anything. Please help us get information about our children,” Memon said.
  “Tell us when they are going to release their bodies.”

  Another father was upset about not being able to get the body of his son, Harshad Patel, saying he was told by authorities it will take 72 hours for DNA profiling.
  “The authorities are trying to help but our patience is running out,” he said.
  Most bodies in the crash were badly charred and authorities are using dental samples to run identification checks.
  Jaishankar Pillai, a forensic dentist, told reporters on Friday they had the dental records of 135 charred victims, which can then be matched through reference to victims’ prior dental charts, radiographs or other records.
  Even for doctors, things are getting difficult, as the plane struck a hostel building of the BJ Medical College, where many of the dead are undergoing identification checks.
  “Most of us are struggling with our emotions and are mentally disturbed because of the loss of friends and colleagues,” said one doctor who did not wish to be named.
  “The loss of so many colleagues and friends in this incident is difficult.” — Reuters

“MANA mungkin saya tidak cemburu. Saya juga manusia, ada hati dan perasaan. Tiga dekad saya mengabdikan diri dalam dunia seni.”
  Kata-kata itu sehingga ini masih bermain di fikiran saya. Jujur, sesi fotografi ini sudah ‘disimpan’ lama. Tetapi dengan mudahnya satu demi satu kata-kata artis versatil ini meluncur keluar menyusun aksara.
  Ketika itu, saya melihat penyanyi, pelakon dan penyampai radio ini seolah menyimpan seribu satu rasa tatkala soalan, tiga dekad, sudah puaskah anda sebagai anak seni saya lontarkan perlahan.
  Matanya merenung luar, meninggalkan kesan yang cukup membuatkan saya memperlahankan rentak pertanyaan. Bagi Haiza, senyuman dan gelak tawa yang dipamerkan belum tentu bercerita jujur dari hati.
  Jika dihitung, usia seninya sama seperti Biduanita Negara, Datuk Seri Siti Nurhaliza. Jauh sekali mahu membandingkan antara dua. Haiza juga ada tempat tersendiri dalam dunia seni, selayaknya dihargai.
  Pernah juga terdetik dalam hatinya, untuk berhenti sahaja dari dunia nyanyian. Namun tidak semudah itu semangatnya dipatahkan. Dia lebih senang memilih untuk berdamai dengan takdir, meraikan kemenangan walaupun kecil.
  “Siapa saya untuk dibandingkan dengan sesiapa. Lagu pun ada satu yang popular. Lima album, tetapi yang satu itu cukup mem­bawa saya ke merata dunia. Ada juga kecewa tetapi tidak lama.
  “Saya ajar diri untuk bersyukur. Satu lagu, tetapi bertahan sehingga kini. Lagu itu buat saya terus ‘hidup’ dalam industri seni. Karier saya berkembang, daripada menyanyi ke berlakon, mengacara dan banyak lagi.
  “Perjalanan tiga dekad itu memang penat. Lebih penat bila ada bisikan jahat bertkata, apa yang kau sudah dapat? Tetapi bila saya toleh kembali, banyak kemenangan yang saya harus rayakan,” katanya.
  Mengulang frasa ‘kecewa’, wanita besi berusia 45 tahun ini sudah acap kali menelan perasaan itu. Terutama ketika irama dangdut ‘dibunuh’ sekitar tahun 1998 apabila kebanyakan stesen radio memperkenalkan format baharu.
  “Di tahun itu, saya seperti hilang arah. Bayangkan, ketika irama dangdut sedang mendunia, tiba-tiba sahaja ‘dibunuh’. Saya ini tahu menyanyi sahaja. Memang bergantung kepada bakat yang ada.
  “Kalau hendak kerja lain, pencapaian akademi tidaklah hebat mana. Saya buntu, kecewa dan remuk rasa. Tetapi saya berjumpa dengan Allahyarham Jaafar Onn. Dialah insan yang memberi ‘nafas’ semula kepada saya,” ujarnya.
  TERIMA KASIH JAAFAR ONN 
  Perlahan Haiza melepaskan nafas. Seperti ada beban rasa yang sedang dipikul tatkala perbualan mula terarah kepada Allahyarham Jaafar Onn. Mereka cukup dekat, seperti ayah dan anak.
  Di usia yang cukup muda, ketika dia hilang arah, Allahyarham dan rakan-rakan artis lain menghulurkan tangan dan berkongsi kesusahan terutama di waktu itu, dunia mengalami kegawatan ekonomi yang cukup parah.
  Apatah lagi, rakan sama merasa senang dan susah seperti Rohana Jalil, Nassier Wahab dan Maya Matahari sudah lebih awal pulang ke negeri abadi. Pastilah kerinduan terhadap mereka membeban rasa.
  “Papa (panggilan Jaafar) ajar saya untuk jadi pengacara. Menyanyi sahaja tidak cukup. Dari situ, kami sama-sama berusaha untuk cari rezeki. Apa dia makan, saya makan. Kami tidak berkira.
  “Waktu itu ada Kak Rohana, Maya, Abang Nassier dan ramai lagi. Kami sama-sama buat persembahan. Apa yang dapat, dikongsi bersama. Saya cukup rindukan detik itu. Bahagia sangat rasa,” katanya sebak.
  Mula belajar tentang hidup dengan berkongsi pengalaman bersama insan-insan seni hebat, Haiza mula menyusun strategi. Tidak hanya menyanyi, dia mula mengacara, berlakon dan kini bergelar penyampai radio.
  “Pernah juga rasa, tak lama usia seni saya ini. Lebih-lebih lagi zaman Akademi Fantasia dan program realiti lain. Tetapi bila kita ada bakat lain, dari situ orang lebih senang ambil khidmat kita.
  “Bila jadi pengacara, boleh menyanyi. Pakej lah kan. Saya juga jenis tidak kisah, asal berpatutan bayarannya memang saya akan beri 120 peratus. Yang janji, tuan rumah berpuas hati,” katanya.
  DAG DIG DUG 2025 
  Bakal melancarkan semula Dag Dig Dug dengan format dan susunan muzik berbeza, Haiza mahu meraikan lagu yang menjadi asbab dia kekal relevan sehingga kini. Baginya, lagu itu harus dirayakan.
  Bukan tidak mahu keluar dengan single baharu, tetapi dia merasakan, dengan lagu itu sahaja, orang mengenal siapa Haiza. Puluhan lagu dari lima album belum tentu mampu mengekalkan dia dalam posisi ini.
  “Hendak buat lagu baharu mahal. Semua guna duit sendiri. Lagipun, saya rasa orang sudah tidak mahu dengar lagu baharu dari saya. Lebih baik saya beri nafas baharu kepada Dag Dig Dug.
  “Apatah lagi, di era media sosial, banyak lagu lama yang di-dugem kan. Jadi saya berkolaborasi dengan music arranger di Bandung, Indonesia hasil perbincangan dengan komposer dan penyanyi hebat, Panji Sakti.
  “Insya-Allah, rakaman sudah selesai. Saya fikir, tidak lama lagi saya akan lancarkan. Diharap peminat saya sejak 30 tahun lalu akan menerima Dag Dig Dug versi 2025,” ujar penyampai radio Kool 101 itu.
  GV DAN TEKANAN 
  Nama Haiza kembali mekar selepas penglibatannya dalam program realiti, Gegar Vaganza 2. Biarpun tidak bergelar juara malah tidak tersenarai dalam tiga teratas, namun nama penyanyi itu semakin disegani.
  Kehebatannya dalam melagukan karya tanpa bergantung kepada genre dangdut semata membuka mata peminat yang selama ini mungkin menganggap dia penyanyi genre tersebut semata-mata.
  “Kalau orang tanya, turning point saya bila, jawapan saya mudah, GV. Selepas itu, rezeki saya mencurah-curah dan mula dapat perhatian sehingga ditawarkan untuk menjadi penyampai radio.
  “Kalau ikutkan, saya hampir sahaja tarik diri. Penat, tertekan dan kekangan kewangan membuatkan saya hampir berputus asa. Tetapi demi peminat yang menyokong saban minggu, kental juga.
  “Alhamdulillah, itulah detik pemula untuk saya kembali bertapak dalam industri seni. Walaupun mungkin tidak sebagai penyanyi, saya dapat peluang dalam bidang berbeza. Itu juga rezeki bukan?” kongsinya.

PONTIAN: Hampir empat tahun dilaksanakan, projek naik taraf padang mini Rambah dekat sini gagal disiapkan, meskipun isu itu sering dibangkitkan dalam Mesyuarat Tindakan Daerah.
  Jawapan diterima daripada Jabatan Kerja Raya (JKR) juga didakwa amat mengecewakan.
  Ahli Dewan Undangan Negeri (ADUN) Kukup, Datuk Jefridin Atan meminta JKR memberi penjelasan sebab kelewatan projek sakit yang dimulakan sejak 28 September 2022.
  Beliau berkata, ketika ini hanya kelihatan astaka atau tempat duduk penonton dibina oleh kontraktor dan menyebabkan keluasan padang bola semakin kecil.
  “Yang diminta oleh penduduk ialah menaik taraf padang tersebut menjadi lebih baik, lebih rata dan sesuai untuk permainan bola sepak, membina tandas dan bilik persalinan bukannya astaka atau tempat duduk penonton yang diberikan keutamaan.
  “Kita tak faham dengan skop kerja sehingga menyebabkan berlaku kelewatan yang terlalu lama, terpaksa diberikan tambahan masa, tetapi masih gagal disiapkan,” katanya kepada Utusan Malaysia.
  Jefridin berkata, kegagalan projek menaik taraf menyebabkan golongan belia tidak dapat menggunakannya hingga hari ini.
  Penduduk, Azhar Abu Bakar, 56, berkata, padang yang dibina pada 1980 itu merupakan tempat golongan belia bermain bola sepak termasuk anak muda dari Kampung Parit Raja, Kampung Rimba Terjun dan Kampung Parit Rambai.
  “Selain berhampiran beberapa buah rumah, terdapat juga inap desa dan dewan bagi penganjuran majlis termasuk perkahwinan. Jika kawasan terbiar, ia pasti memberi persepsi buruk terutama dalam kalangan orang luar,” katanya. – UTUSAN

A local junta jet that crashed in a war zone this week killed four people as it smashed into a village where civilians were sheltering from fighting, a local official said.
  Anti-coup guerillas claimed they downed the jet on Tuesday after four days of intense combat in central Sagaing region, while Myanmar’s junta said it crashed because of “sudden engine failure”.
  Zaw Htet, a local administrator from the rebel-held area, said there were four fatalities as the jet destroyed five buildings on impact in the village of Sa Par Sayt.
  “They were killed in their hou­ses. Three of them were IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons) who came to stay at the village,” said Zaw Htet.
  Analysis of social media images of the crash site by the Britain-based Centre for Information Resilience’s Myanmar Witness project identified the jet as a Chinese-manufactured single-seat Chengdu F-7.
  Myanmar’s military has suffered stinging territorial losses in recent months, but analysts say its air force backed by China and Russia has been key to fending off its myriad opponents.
  The military and some of its adversaries have pledged a truce this month as the country conti­nues to recover from March’s devastating earthquake which killed nearly 3,800 people.
  But the People’s Liberation Army – a communist group which took up arms after the coup -- said it downed the jet 130km west of Mandalay city, the area worst-hit by the tremor.
  The junta information team said the jet had been on a training flight when it was stricken by a technical malfunction. — AFP

The nation said talks with neighbour Cambodia had “made progress” in resolving a long-running border dispute that last month devolved into clashes.
  Troops from the two countries exchanged fire on May 28 in an area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of Cambodia, Thailand and Laos meet, with one Cambodian soldier killed.
  The Thai and Cambodian armies both said they had acted in self-defence, but agreed to reposition their soldiers to avoid confrontations.
  Thailand has tightened border controls with Cambodia in recent days, while Cambodia ordered troops on Friday to stay on “full alert”.
  Officials from the two countries had agreed to resolve the spat at a meeting yesterday in the Cam­bodian capital Phnom Penh.
  Foreign ministry adviser Prasas Prasasvinitchai was leading the Thai delegation, while Lam Chea, minister of state in charge of the Secretariat of Border Affairs, headed the Cambodian contingent.
  Thailand’s foreign ministry said yesterday that the meeting had “made progress in building mutual understanding” between the two countries.
  Thai foreign ministry spokesman Nikorndej Balankura said in a press conference that “diplomatic dialogue remains the most effective way forward”, adding that talks would carry on today.
  The row dates to the drawing of the 800km frontier, largely done during the French occupation of Indochina.
  The region has seen sporadic violence since 2008, resulting in at least 28 deaths.
  Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet announced earlier this month that Cambodia would file a complaint with the Inter­national Court of Justice (ICJ) over four disputed border areas, including the site of the latest clash.
  Hun Manet said in a Facebook post Friday that the four areas and the border restrictions would not be discussed at yesterday’s talks.
  “Cambodia awaits Thailand to clarify its official position at (yesterday’s) meeting on whether Thailand will join Cambodia in referring the four areas to the ICJ,” he said.
  The ICJ ruled in 2013 that a disputed area next to Preah Vihear temple belonged to Cambodia, but Thailand says it does not accept the ICJ’s jurisdiction. — AFP

PHNOM PENH: Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said on Saturday (June 14) that his government is fully prepared to deal with any mass return of Cambodian migrant workers from Thailand as border tensions have mounted.
  "In case of a large-scale return, due to any reason, of our Cambodian workers from Thailand, the government has already prepared all necessary measures to manage the situation," he said in a post on his official social media platforms.
  He said ministries and concerned institutions, all kinds of armed forces and authorities in all seven Thai border provinces are getting ready to facilitate border crossing, temporary accommodation, and meals for returnees in border areas.
  He added that the ministry of national defence, the army,and the Phnom Penh Municipality have prepared transportation to facilitate the return of migrant workers to their home provinces.
  Hun Manet added that the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training is ready to help them find jobs in the country, as about 70,000 vacancies remain in various industries across the country.
  He said the ministry of economy and finance is working with relevant ministries and institutions to develop a social and economic aid package to ease the financial burden for them.
  He also urged the Association of Banks in Cambodia and the Cambodia Microfinance Association to consider debt relief options for returnees.
  Meanwhile, Senate President Samdech Techo Hun Sen, who is also president of the ruling Cambodian People's Party, urged Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home.

  PHNOM PENH, June 15 (Bernama) -- Cambodia officially submitted a request to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Sunday to seek a resolution to the ongoing border dispute with Thailand.
  Prime Minister Hun Manet said that the decision was to safeguard Cambodia’s territorial integrity and for the best interest of the nation and Cambodians. 
  “Cambodia only seeks justice, accuracy and clarity in the demarcation of its borders with neighbouring countries, so that future generations will not face ongoing disputes,” Manet said in a Facebook posting this morning.
  The dispute related to the Ta Moan Thom, Ta Moan Tauch, Ta Krabei temples, and the Mom Bei (Emerald Triangle) will be referred to the ICJ.
  He said that, coincidentally – 63 years ago – June 15, 1962, was a historic day when the ICJ had ruled in favour of Cambodia in the Preah Vihear Temple case.
  “Although these two events happened 63 years apart, the spirit and objective remain the same,” said Manet.
  This is the third time Cambodia has sought the intervention of the ICJ,  in 1962 and 2013, over the territory surrounding the Preah Vihear Temple.
  On both occasions, the United Nations court ruled in favour of Cambodia. 
  “Cambodia chooses a peaceful resolution based on international laws through the ICJ mechanism for solving border dispute in the areas where issues are very complicated and have high risks of armed clashes and where bilateral mechanisms cannot solve,” said the prime minister.
  Cambodia had been firm in referring the border dispute to the ICJ, even if Thailand did not agree.
  The unilateral decision comes when the sixth Cambodia-Thailand Joint Boundary (JBC) meeting is being held in Phnom Penh.
  The meeting is scheduled to resume on Sunday after the first dialogue on Saturday. 
  Both countries are locked in a bitter dispute following a brief clash between Cambodian and Thai border troops on May 28 in the northern Preah Vihear province area, leaving one Cambodian soldier dead.

:
Cambodia has asked the International Court of Justice to help resolve a Thai border dispute that turned into a bloody military clash last month, prime minister Hun Manet said today.
One Cambodian soldier was killed on May 28 as troops exchanged fire in a disputed area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of Cambodia, Thailand and Laos meet.
The Thai and Cambodian armies both said they had acted in self-defence, but agreed to reposition their soldiers to avoid confrontations.
Thailand has tightened border controls with Cambodia in recent days, while Cambodia ordered troops on Friday to stay on “full alert” and banned Thai dramas from TV and cinemas.
Hun Manet said in a Facebook post today that “Cambodia submitted an official letter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to seek a resolution on the border dispute” in four areas – the site of last month’s clash and three ancient temples.
“Cambodia chooses international law and peace,” the Cambodian leader said.
“Cambodia only needs justice, fairness and clarity in border demarcation and delimitation with our neighbouring countries, so that our future generations will not continue to have issues with each other.”

BANGKOK (Reuters) -Cambodia said on Sunday it has asked the International Court of Justice to resolve its border disputes with Thailand, after a flare-up in the long-running row led the Southeast Asian neighbours to mobilise troops on both sides of the border.
  A Cambodian soldier was killed in a brief skirmish on May 28 in a confrontation over the 820-km (510-mile) frontier, parts of which are undemarcated and claimed by both nations.    
  "Cambodia chooses a peaceful resolution based on international law through the ICJ mechanism for solving the border dispute," Prime Minister Hun Manet posted on his Facebook page.
  The post shows a picture of Deputy Prime Minister Prak Sokhonn holding an envelope that Hun Manet said contained a formal letter to the ICJ in The Hague, often called the World Court.
  The Thai Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Cambodia's move. Bangkok has previously said it has never recognised the court's jurisdiction and prefers to settle the disputes through bilateral mechanisms.
  Officials from both countries were meeting in Phnom Penh through the weekend in an attempt to ease tensions amid fears of more military clashes.
  Hun Manet said the disputes at the four border areas, including the one where the fatal clash took place, are "complicated and have high risks of armed clashes and where bilateral mechanisms cannot solve".
  He did not disclose the contents of the letter, which were not visible in the picture.
  Cambodia has twice successfully sought ICJ resolutions, in 1962 on the ownership of the disputed Preah Vihear temple and in 2013, after it sought clarification of jurisdiction of the land around the temple.
  Although both governments have pledged to handle the issue through dialogue and to calm nationalist fervour, Bangkok has threatened to close the border and cut off electricity supplies to its neighbour.
  Phnom Penh announced it would cease buying Thai electric power, internet bandwidth and produce. It has also ordered local television stations not to screen Thai films.

不过，泰国早前表明拒绝与柬埔寨一同入禀国际法院。泰柬昨天在金边召开会议商讨划界问题和边境争端，并将在今天持续进行会谈。
柬埔寨周五（13日）命令军队在与泰国的边境争端中保持“全面戒备”，同时下令电视台和电影院停止播放泰剧和泰国电影。
泰柬军队上月28日在两国边境的冲博地区短暂交火，造成一名柬埔寨士兵死亡。泰国随后以国家主权和安全受威胁为由，短暂关闭两个边境口岸，禁止游客出入，后来重新开放，可是缩短通关时间。两国也缩短了双方游客的签证有效期。

BANGKOK, June 15 — Cambodia said today it has asked the International Court of Justice to resolve its border disputes with Thailand, after a flare-up in the long-running row led the Southeast Asian neighbours to mobilise troops on both sides of the border.
  A Cambodian soldier was killed in a brief skirmish on May 28 in a confrontation over the 820-km (510-mile) frontier, parts of which are undemarcated and claimed by both nations.
  “Cambodia chooses a peaceful resolution based on international law through the ICJ mechanism for solving the border dispute,” Prime Minister Hun Manet posted on his Facebook page.
  The post shows a picture of Deputy Prime Minister Prak Sokhonn holding an envelope that Hun Manet said contained a formal letter to the ICJ in The Hague, often called the World Court.
  The Thai Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Cambodia’s move. Bangkok has previously said it has never recognised the court’s jurisdiction and prefers to settle the disputes through bilateral mechanisms.
  Officials from both countries were meeting in Phnom Penh through the weekend in an attempt to ease tensions amid fears of more military clashes.
  Hun Manet said the disputes at the four border areas, including the one where the fatal clash took place, are “complicated and have high risks of armed clashes and where bilateral mechanisms cannot solve”.
  He did not disclose the contents of the letter, which were not visible in the picture.
  Cambodia has twice successfully sought ICJ resolutions, in 1962 on the ownership of the disputed Preah Vihear temple and in 2013, after it sought clarification of jurisdiction of the land around the temple.
  Although both governments have pledged to handle the issue through dialogue and to calm nationalist fervour, Bangkok has threatened to close the border and cut off electricity supplies to its neighbour.
  Phnom Penh announced it would cease buying Thai electric power, internet bandwidth and produce. It has also ordered local television stations not to screen Thai films. — Reuters

柬埔寨边境事务国务秘书处会后发布新闻稿称，“会议在友好、理解的氛围中举行，并秉持着开放、积极的对话精神”，且未触及大塔蒙古寺、小塔蒙古寺、塔戈拉贝古寺及三角地区这4处争议地带。
此次会议，柬埔寨代表团由边境事务秘书处部长郎杰率领，泰方则由外交部边界事务顾问帕拉萨担任首席代表。
根据新闻稿，郎杰向泰方重申，除上述个地区外，柬方将继续通过JBC机制与泰方合作，推进边界勘测、划界和设立界碑工作。
他重申柬方将根据2000年谅解备忘录中概述的法律文件和双方商定的地图，与泰国划定和平、友好与合作的边界。这包括使用1:200,000比例尺的地图进行划界和设立标记，以符合1904年《法暹条约》和1907年《法暹条约》的精神。
他强调，柬方坚决反对泰方单方面绘制和使用的地图，有关地图是过去、现在以及未来潜在边界争端的根源。
双方同意今年9月再次举行JBC会议。

星期日在脸书发文，回应
柬埔寨
前总理洪森“呼吁柬籍
劳工
被泰方驱逐前尽快回国”的言论。佩通坦强调，泰国向来秉持开放包容的态度，欢迎外籍劳工，为合法入境工作的劳工提供福利保障，同时坚持尊重人权的基本原则。
她指出，泰国政府从未有过驱逐任何外籍劳工出境的想法。但是若某些国家出台政策要求工人回国，并安排了就业岗位，则是劳工自主决定的自由权利，也属该国政府的职责范畴。

她郑重承诺，不会将国际关系议题变成国内政治操作的工具，并呼吁各国出台政策时，勿以自身政治利益为出发点，避免对局势带来负面影响。
泰国劳工部长皮帕13日也强调，劳工的去留是个人自由，柬方无权强制，泰国政府也不会干涉。
他说，目前在泰国工作的柬籍劳工大约有50万人，劳工部已指示相关部门对各地情况进行持续监控，并与雇佣机构保持联络，确保有应急预案。
他补充，即使柬籍劳工全部撤出，泰国依然有能力寻找替代人力资源，劳工部已制定多元人力战略，确保重点行业人力不受影响。

JAKARTA (Bernama): A territorial dispute over four small islands in western Indonesia has reached the highest level of government, with President Prabowo Subianto stepping in to mediate rising tensions between the provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra.
  The islands - Pulau Mangkir Gadang, Pulau Mangkir Ketek, Pulau Lipan, and Pulau Panjang - became the subject of a controversy after the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a decree in April 2025 formalising a 2022 decision to reassign them from Aceh Singkil to Central Tapanuli in North Sumatra.
  The move triggered protests from Acehnese communities and civil groups, including the Aceh Students’ Association of Greater Jakarta, who called for the decree to be revoked and for the ministry to acknowledge what they claimed was an administrative error.
  Aceh Governor Muzakir Manaf, also known as Mualem, argued that the islands had long belonged to Aceh based on historical and administrative records, and suggested that the dispute might be linked to offshore resource interests.
  Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, confirmed on Saturday via a statement to local media that President Prabowo had agreed to address the issue personally.
  "The president has taken over the matter of the islands’ boundary dispute,” said Sufmi, a close confidant of Prabowo, as quoted by national news agency Antara.
  He added that a decision is expected next week.
  Meanwhile, Home Affairs Minister Tito Karnavian defended the reclassification, emphasising that historical records indicate the dispute over the islands had existed since 1928.
  While acknowledging the dissatisfaction among some quarters, he noted that legal avenues such as the Administrative Court (Pengadilan Tata Usaha Negara, or PTUN) remain available.
  Earlier this month, North Sumatra Governor Bobby Nasution visited Aceh to discuss a collaborative approach to managing the islands, including opportunities for tourism and other areas of joint economic development.
  Mualem, a former commander of the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), welcomed Bobby but delegated further talks to provincial officials due to prior engagements in Southwest Aceh.
  The dispute has reopened old wounds regarding longstanding issues in Aceh, a province with special autonomous status, where matters related to governance and territorial boundaries remain sensitive despite a 2005 peace agreement. - Bernama

HAVE you ever felt like a background character in someone else’s story, just trying to keep up so you wouldn’t feel left out?
  Being around people who constantly centred themselves – or had main character syndrome (MCS) – while I silently dealt with the fear of missing out (FOMO) made me question my place and even how I saw myself.
  Evangelene: It’s important to be mindful of the people we surround ourselves with – especially in today’s social media-driven world.“Is it going to stay like this for the rest of my life?“ my younger self would wonder.
  As an introvert, I never really knew how to put myself out there comfortably. When I started lower secondary, making friends didn’t happen instantly, but I eventually became part of one or two friend groups.
  Soon, however, I noticed a pattern: the conversations always circled back to them. No matter what topic I brought to the table, I felt unheard.
  Due to personal boundaries and limited chances to go out, I often declined hangouts. When their memories were later shared, I couldn’t help feeling excluded.
  Eventually, I hit burnout – not just from keeping up, but also from trying to belong somewhere that no longer felt right.
  That’s when I took a step back. Seeing the bigger picture changed how I perceived things.
  I realised it wasn’t as big of a deal as I had made it out to be. I didn’t need to be in their spotlight to matter, nor live up to everyone’s expectations to feel valued.
  What I truly needed was to find peace with myself and be grateful for what I already had – instead of chasing validation.
  Fast forward to today, I have found amazing friends who bring support, warmth and laughter into my life.
  By stepping back, I learnt to reflect on what I wanted in a friendship, not just what I could give.
  It’s important to be mindful of the people we surround ourselves with – especially in today’s social media-driven world.
  MCS and FOMO are real, and they reveal a hidden truth: many of us are seeking validation in the wrong places.
  Social media only amplifies these feelings, making us feel left behind just because we’re not seen.
  The impact of MCS and FOMO can only hold us back for so long. It’s up to us to break free from those expectations and embrace who we really are.
  Take a step back – not to give up but to move forward more mindfully. Reflect on your life, and remember: you don’t need to “fit in” or be in the spotlight to truly matter.

At age 76, having lived through the evolution of Malaysia’s education system from colonial to post-independence times, I feel compelled to share some reflections.
  These concerns, drawn from decades of observation and engagement, are not mine alone – they echo the sentiments of many parents, educators and policymakers across the country.
  The Malaysian education system has come a long way. In 1968, when I completed Form Six at Malacca High School – the second oldest school in the country – tertiary education options were limited.
  Universiti Malaya (UM) stood as the premier institution of higher learning, while Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) had just been established and was still finding its footing.
  Most of us aspired to enter UM, proud to be associated with its academic excellence. Today, access to education has improved, but not without cost.
  The rapid proliferation of institutions has raised concerns about the erosion of standards, the quality of instruction and the lowering of entry criteria. In our rush to expand, have we sacrificed excellence?
  Our education reforms often chase outcomes – exam results, rankings, employability metrics – while neglecting the heartbeat of any system: the teacher, lecturer and professor.
  If we are serious about building national capability, we must restore the nobility and respect once accorded to the teaching profession.
  Reviving the profession 
  In the 1950s and 60s, teachers were revered figures in our communities – moral guides, intellectual leaders, and pillars of social cohesion. Today, many feel overworked, underpaid and underappreciated.
  One cannot ignore the growing administrative burdens placed on teachers. Hours that should be spent nurturing students are consumed by paperwork, data entry and bureaucratic processes. This diverts energy away from teaching and drains morale. A teaching career should be about shaping lives, not ticking boxes.
  In rural areas, the situation is even more stark with teachers operating in isolation, battling infrastructural challenges and social neglect. If education is to be a leveller, these disparities must be addressed urgently.
  Teachers are central to education reform. While many dedicated teachers continue to uphold high standards, recruitment quality has declined, particularly in less urbanised areas. Entry requirements for teacher training institutes must be reviewed, with greater emphasis placed on mentorship, professional development and rigorous screening.
  Unfortunately, teaching is no longer seen as a desirable profession by many young people. Parents, too, discourage their children from becoming teachers, perceiving it as low-paying and unglamorous.
  Better salaries in other sectors, limited career mobility and a decline in social prestige have led top-performing students to avoid the profession. Unless we make teaching competitive, rewarding and respected once again, we will lose the very people we depend on to shape our future generations.
  National investment 
  Our curriculum needs urgent rethinking. It has become crowded and fragmented, trying to do too much in too little time.
  Religious and moral education is vital in character development and faith formation, but this must be balanced with core academic learning.
  Similarly, well-meaning agendas – encompassing everything from anti-corruption to environmental, social and governance and financial literacy – must be integrated with care and purpose, not as checkbox additions.
  Ensuring quality in the rising number of religious schools – some private, others unlicensed – is a major challenge that must be handled with professionalism and objectivity to ensure that students, regardless of the system they are in, receive quality education that prepares them to be marketable and morally grounded for a borderless, digital world.
  Education must be treated as a national investment in people, values and capability. This is not just about what students learn in school – it is also about what kind of society we are shaping.
  Parents must take responsibility to ensure that their children are not just passing exams but are genuinely prepared to engage with the world and earn a living.
  If young graduates remain unemployed or unemployable, part of the responsibility lies with the home environment and the expectations set from an early age.
  There is much to be done. For a start, Malaysia should study education systems that have proven effective – such as those in Finland, Singapore and Japan – not to blindly copy them, but to identify and adapt their best practices to suit our national context. Let us blend global benchmarks with our unique multicultural strengths and local needs.
  Ideology and politics should never be allowed to hijack or influence what should be an apolitical national priority.
  Let us reclaim the soul of our education system. Let us restore the dignity of teaching. Let us create schools and universities that develop not just minds, but also character competence and marketability. The future of our children, and indeed the soul of our nation, depends on it.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Paris St Germain is drawing inspiration from the success of new state-of-the-art venues in Los Angeles as the Champions League title winners begin the process of building a new stadium for the team, CEO Victoriano Melero said. 
  PSG has outgrown the 48,000-capacity Parc des Princes, and team officials will spend a year studying potential sites in Massy and Poissy with an eye toward offering a variety of entertainment options, Melero said. 
  "The next challenge is a new stadium," Melero told Reuters in Los Angeles ahead of PSG's Club World Cup match on Sunday in Pasadena. 
  "For one year we're going to go into an analysis and make a choice for our future, and we're inspired by what is going on in the U.S. with sports facilities," he said.
  "One example here is SoFi Stadium. It's incredible and much more than a sports facility - it really is part of entertainment and shows. So that is what we really want to push to diversify our revenue." 
  SoFi Stadium, a technological marvel that opened in 2020, is home to the NFL's Rams and Chargers and has hosted concerts by artists like Taylor Swift and Beyonce. It will play a key role in next summer's World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. 
  The $5 billion stadium is located in Hollywood Park, a growing commercial and residential area. The 70,000-capacity indoor-outdoor stadium sits next to Intuit Dome, the high-tech NBA arena that opened last year.
  PSG is looking at Massy, south of Paris, and Poissy, west of the French capital, as potential sites for a new stadium. The team will play Parc des Princes for the foreseeable future while the new stadium is built. 
  U.S. fans and investors have played a vital role in the stunning success of the club both on and off the field, said Adrien Frier, the French consul-general in Los Angeles. 
  "Paris St Germain is what you would call in the tech sector a unicorn, and it's a unicorn that has some American blood in it," he said at a reception honoring the team in Beverly Hills, where the Champions League trophy was on display. 
  PSG has an estimated five million fans in the U.S. and has benefited from its high-profile partnership with Nike's iconic Air Jordan brand. 
  U.S.-based Arctos Partners holds 12.5% of the shares of the team, with majority owner Qatar Sports Investments owning the remaining 87.5% for a club that is valued at $4.4 billion.
  Melero said the team's ambitions are only growing. 
  "We wrote the story of the club with that cup," he said, gesturing toward the gleaming trophy. 
  "And right now the next move is to write the story of football with this very young team."

SANDAKAN: Sabah is experiencing a troubling increase in lifestyle-related illnesses as the state faces a "double burden" of malnutrition, where communities suffer from both undernutrition and excessive calorie intake.
  Sabah Health Department director Dr Maria Suleiman said the rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes as well as high blood pressure and strokes are linked to unhealthy diets and a lack of physical activity.
  “We are dealing with a dual challenge—undernutrition on one hand and overconsumption of calories on the other, along with poor dietary choices. If we consume too much, we open ourselves up to health issues such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure,” she said.
  She spoke to reporters after officiating the Jom Sihat Sandakan programme at Sejati Walk on Saturday.
  Dr Maria said 298 new stroke cases were recorded at Hospital Queen Elizabeth and 198 at Hospital Duchess of Kent in 2024, many related to high blood pressure. She urged communities to take proactive steps to improve their health through better diets and increased physical activity.
  She also highlighted a steady increase in chronic illnesses across the state based on data from the National Health and Morbidity Survey.
  “For diabetes, the prevalence in Sabah rose from 5.7% in 2011 to 8.8% in 2023. Dyslipidemia increased slightly from 31% to 32%, while overweight rates rose from 28% to 30.9%. Obesity—very concerning—almost doubled from 10.6% to 19.5%,” she said.
  The programme featured health screenings, nutrition exhibitions, counselling sessions, interactive activities, and talks aimed at raising awareness of healthy lifestyles.
  Dr Maria added that the initiative supports the National Nutrition Policy’s goal of promoting sustainable food systems and improving access to nutritious diets.

沙巴卫生局总监玛丽亚医生说，国家健康与发病率调查的数据显示，沙巴的慢性疾病不断增加，例如糖尿病的患病率从2011年的5.7%升至2023年的8.8%。
ADVERTISEMENT
“血脂异常患病率则从31%微升至32%；超重率也从28%上升至30.9%。而最令人担忧的是肥胖问题，其比率几乎翻倍，从10.6%激增至19.5%。”
她也指出，沙巴的中风病例也呈上升趋势。2024年，亚庇伊丽莎白女皇医院录得298宗新增病例，山打根肯特医院则有198宗。
她说，大多数中风病例都与高血压问题密切相关。
玛丽亚是昨天于Sejati Walk主持“山打根一起来健康”计划开幕仪式时，发表上述谈话。
她表示，我国包括沙巴正面临“双重负担”，即一方面是营养不良，另一方面是热量摄取过多。
“如果长期摄取过量，就会增加患上糖尿病、血脂异常和高血压等疾病的风险。”
她呼吁民众控制饮食，避免营养失衡，并养成健康的生活习惯，适当运动以燃烧多余热量。

SST Expansion A Strategic Window For Business Readiness, Says MAICCI Women’s Wing Head
KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 (Bernama) -- The expansion of the Sales and Service Tax (SST) beginning July 1, 2025, is seen as a timely and strategic move that provides businesses, particularly women-led enterprises, with the clarity and space to strengthen operations and build long-term resilience.
Malaysian Associated Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (MAICCI) Women’s Wing Head, Dr Hemala AP Sivam, said the government’s decision reflects an inclusive and responsive approach to policymaking that balances fiscal goals with the practical needs of the business community.
“This move allows businesses, especially those led by women, to review their operations, reskill their workforce, and realign themselves to meet future demands,” she said in a statement to Bernama today.
Hemala, who is also the food manufacturer APS Manja Sdn Bhd’s executive director, said the revised SST framework offers a crucial opportunity for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), manufacturers and women entrepreneurs to strengthen internal capabilities and prepare for regulatory changes.
“It is a chance to optimise cash flow, invest in automation, and adopt digital tools. For women entrepreneurs balancing both economic and caregiving responsibilities, this period offers the policy clarity and structured space they need to grow sustainably,” she said.
The government will implement the SST revision and expansion starting July 1 to enhance national revenue and broaden the tax base in support of long-term fiscal sustainability.
Finance Minister II Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan said the Sales Tax rate will remain unchanged for essential goods, while a rate of either five or 10 per cent will apply to non-essential or discretionary items.
The Service Tax will be expanded to cover additional sectors such as rental and leasing, construction, finance, private healthcare, education, and beauty services.
Selective exemptions will be introduced to avoid double taxation and to ensure that essential services for Malaysians are not burdened.
Hemala urged businesses to use the current period to strengthen compliance mechanisms and engage with relevant ministries, chambers of commerce, and entrepreneurial networks to ensure effective implementation.
“This is not just a tax revision, it is a catalyst for dialogue, innovation and strategic transformation. We support the government’s efforts to ensure the SST framework remains transparent, equitable, and aligned with national development goals,” she said.
Hemala also stressed the importance of inclusive policies that address the unique challenges faced by women entrepreneurs, particularly in rural and underserved areas.
“With targeted support, digital access and capacity-building initiatives, women-led enterprises can become a vital force in strengthening Malaysia’s economic resilience,” she added.

（关丹15日讯）关丹惠州会馆会长拿督斯里李锦贤认为，政府扩大销售与服务税(SST)征税范围已错配时机、搞错方向，应该
无限期展延
至我国经济生态重回活络逢勃时。
李锦贤今天中午出席关丹惠州会馆妇女组与青年团联合主办的“摆设粽子观摩赛”开幕仪式致词时表示，虽然各领域业者不断进言请愿，要求政府暂缓推动扩大SST范围，不过政府却一意孤行，不理会商家民众的处境。
ADVERTISEMENT
“政府的决策根本没有考虑到关税贸易大战仍然阴霾笼罩、地缘治政冲突频传、各国政府纷纷调低经济成长数据。政府其实应大手笔拨款补贴津贴，而不是不断增加抽税，打压企业运作，破坏市场根基。
“从整体财经政策来看，政府的用意令人质疑，在这个困难时期，为什么频频祭出打击商贸，纷扰市场的政策？”
他说，从7月1日开始，6大领域的商品和服务，被强制列入SST范围，引起市场震荡波动，牵连各行各业酝酿涨价风潮，也是在所难免的事情。
“在经济低迷，市场疲弱的时刻，增抽新税或者扩大征税项目，是一个十分恶劣败坏的政策。因此，所谓‘扩大SST征税，能够增加国家税收，又不会造成太大的影响’是不可靠，也没有论据的说词。
“几天前，商家民众好不容易争取暂缓推动电子发票，也因此纷纷以为，在年底封关之前，可以安心运作，但是，坏消息始终出炉，未来的日子越来越难过。
“政府也刚宣布年度营业额50万令吉者可暂时豁免接受电子发票，但是，半年之后，又再卷土重来。在时间上来看，半年之后的经济生态，不可能回升活络，反而，随时因为国际区域变数，陷入更加低迷不振。
“事实上，展延只是权宜之计，不是实际有效的解决方案，不能解决草根商家的困境。50万令吉营业额的中小微型商家，其实属于草根生意人，平日营赚谋生已足够辛苦艰难，如果政府不能帮忙援助，至少不要刁难打压。因此，我们认为；年度营业额不超过50万令吉的草根商家，应该获得永久性豁免电子发票。”
“承认统考”运动陷入低调沉寂
李锦贤也感叹在我国政权改朝换代以后，承认统考运动开始陷入低调沉寂，民间社团组织过去召开常年大会，一定把统考列入大会提案，现在却难得一见。
“由当年剧烈抗争转向不理不问，这个大幅度转变意味着什么？是不是表示，争取统考的动作和声音，因为政权更替，变得不重要，不值得关注了？在我看来，统考是华教运动的标志，一旦失去统考的加持和导航，华教运动将沦为什么都不是。
“因此，无论政治环境怎样变更，谁人在朝，谁人在野，社团组织肩负民族使命，必须长期关注统考的命运，最低限度，在常年大会列入提案，唤醒民众普遍讨论和关注。”
江瑞云:不如重启GST
开幕嘉宾，关丹惠州会馆妇女组名誉顾问拿督江瑞云致词时指出，政府扩大SST动机在于改善国库营收，然而在SST难以达到抽税目标的情况下，与其不断抬高扩大范围，不如重启消费税(GST), 扩大抽税基础，缩小纰漏逃税空间，更符合政府的税务规划。
“根据专家的看法，SST的范围十分狭隘，抽来抽去都是同样的群体在缴税。相对来看，重启GST能够扩大缴税基础，让更多人同时贡献税务，可以认真改善目前的弱点。
“根据最新数据，2024年尾，一共有1670万人民参与正规职业，但是，只有大约280万或17％的员工实际贡献税务，其他人不但没有缴税，反而享受各类型补贴，导致政府承受越来越严重的财务负担。

“因此，推开当朝政府与前朝政府之间的政治恩怨，不再纠结于过去谁对谁错，我们促请政府在来届预算案，毅然重启GST。”
此外，她也狠批多媒体委员会开始强制规定，指示电讯公司交出手机机密资料，包括个人账号，通话和浏览网络的记录。
“虽然政府澄清，这项收集行动，以匿名方式展开，不会揭露手机用户的机密资料，但是，我们也约略知道，经过内部技术加工，个人机密资料可以迅速还原，查清用户的身份、行踪及通电记录，以及在社交媒体发表什么贴文等等。
“我们坚持，除非用于追查罪案，电讯公司应该保障用户机密，拒绝政府的非分要求。在个人资料保护法令下(PDPA), 所有机密资料，无论在线上或线下，应该获得充分保障，不能随便呈交第三者。
“我们也要坚持，这是民主自由国家，不是铁腕专制国家，政府不能为所欲为，过分侦查人民的行踪，干预人民的日常生活，否则，治政行为跟恶名昭彰的朝鲜，没有太大的差别。我们都不要沦落为朝鲜，人民应该站出来发声反对，以捍卫个人隐私权，一起守护宪法底线。”
她也表示，端午裹粽文化历尽2300年依然传承不息。当然，新时代的端午文化，不再牵连爱国主义，转向联系社区友谊，家居团圆。
出席今日活动的嘉宾，包括关丹惠州会馆永久名誉顾问拿督罗英铭．关丹华团妇女组主席范滢月、彭亨苏丹阿都拉大学孔子学院院长杨银梅、关丹惠州会馆笫二副会长张翔坚、妇女组主席梁少琴、执行顾问李月群、青年团团长王鹏权与马来西亚华人穆斯林协会彭亨分会副主席邱莉莉等。

PETALING JAYA, June 15 — With its narrow, densely packed roads and many businesses still run out of converted homes, Sungai Way has an aesthetic unlike other suburbs in Petaling Jaya. 
  While rapid development has transformed much of the city into a landscape of shopping malls and bustling commercial hubs, Sungai Way retains its distinct roots. 
  Established as a Chinese new village under the Briggs Plan, it remains one of the city’s last visible vestiges of Malaysia’s colonial past. 
  As in many former new villages, the eateries that have become pillars of the community are often still run out of a family home, with the people behind them still living under the same roof. 
  Kedai Kopi Hoh Piah is one such spot, and despite the kedai in the name, it is pretty clearly the front of a house. 
  “Kedai Kopi” Hoh Piah operates out of a house. — Picture by Ethan Lau 
  The time-honoured setup is full of worn tables, old but not obsolete, and many regulars come from the neighbourhood for their breakfast, particularly on the weekend. 
  Young families with kids still in their pyjamas, young couples still in their pyjamas... or maybe everyone just felt like pyjamas that morning, and I missed the memo.
  Everyone’s gathered here today for the simple, soul-soothing bowl of noodles that is pan mee. 
  In addition to the standard offerings of dry and soup pan mee (both RM9), there are also left-field options like tom yam, mala soup pan mee, and even a bak kut teh noodle.
  Noodles being made from scratch. — Picture by Ethan Lau 
  It’s telling, then, that when I walk in, it’s not the medicinal scent of bak kut teh or the sharp sting of chillies and tom yam that greets me, but the mild aroma of anchovy broth. 
  Soup is by far the most popular order, and it’s easy to see why. The broth is clear and very light in colour, but it has more depth than it lets on, with a gentle sweetness carried by the anchovy base. 
  A scoop of minced pork adds a touch of savouriness, but the real punch comes from a handful of well-fried, crispy, salty anchovies. 
  Tying it all together is a smack of spicy, tangy sambal. Whether you go for the hand-torn or thick-cut noodles, it’s a satisfying bowl.
  I personally prefer the dry preparation, as I like to really ruminate on the texture of hand-torn mee hoon kueh. 
  The noodles aren’t tossed in a particularly noteworthy sauce, but they’re fairly thin, with a smooth, slippery texture that makes for an easy eating experience and doesn’t demand much chewing. 
  It looks light, but the soup ‘pan mee’ is filled with depth from the anchovy base. — Picture by Ethan Lau 
  I suspect that’s part of the appeal for much of the crowd here.
  Hoh Piah is far from the only eatery in Sungai Way that operates out of a home, and it’s not the only pan mee shop in PJ either. 
  But there’s something about it that feels undeniably Sungai Way. Maybe it is the way it stays put, holds on, and keeps feeding the people around it the same way it has for years. 
  Dry ‘pan mee’ is my favourite way to eat these noodles, which have a satisfying texture. — Picture by Ethan Lau 
  As PJ continues to grow and businesses come and go in the name of progress, I suspect we’ll come to miss places like this — even if the parking never really improves.
  Kedai Kopi Hoh Piah
  75, Jalan SS 9a/4, 
  SS 9a, Petaling Jaya.
  Open Tuesday to Sunday, 8am-2.30pm

BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN (Borneo Bulletin/ANN): A signing ceremony for the Joint-Venture Agreement, Land Lease Agreement and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for a 30-megawatt (MW) Solar Photovoltaics Power Plant (SPVPP) was held at the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) of Brunei.
  The project, to be developed on a remediated landfill site in Kampong Belimbing, marks a significant step forward in Brunei Darussalam’s renewable energy efforts.
  Present as guests of honour were Minister at the Prime Minister’s Office and Minister of Defence II Pehin Datu Lailaraja Major General (Rtd) Dato Paduka Seri Awang Haji Halbi bin Haji Mohd Yussof; and Minister at the Prime Minister’s Office and Minister of Finance and Economy II Dato Seri Setia Dr Awang Haji Mohd Amin Liew bin Abdullah.
  Also in attendance were deputy ministers, permanent secretaries and deputy permanent secretaries from the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Finance and Economy.
  The ceremony began with welcoming remarks, followed by the symbolic signing of the Joint-Venture Agreement, which formalised the creation of a new entity – Seri Suria Power (B) Sdn Bhd.
  Signing were Board Director of Khazanah Satu Sdn Bhd Haji Asrul Adrain bin POKSPDSS Dr Haji Ahmad, Chairman and Managing Director of Serikandi Oilfield Services Sdn Bhd Shaikh Haji Khalid bin Shaikh Haji Ahmad, and Executive Director and Chief Strategy Officer on behalf of Atlantic Blue Sdn Bhd Liew Chee Ing.
  The event continued with the signing of the Land Lease Agreement between the Government of His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar ‘Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddien, Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam and Seri Suria Power (B) Sdn Bhd. Permanent Secretary (Energy) at the Prime Minister’s Office Hajah Farida binti Dato Seri Paduka Haji Talib signed on behalf of the government, while Chief Executive Officer of Seri Suria Power (B) Sdn Bhd Ravi Bhaskaran signed on behalf of the company.
  The ceremony concluded with the signing of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which sets the framework for a 25-year long-term energy supply from the SPVPP.
  Signing the PPA were Acting Director of the Department of Electrical Services Ahmad Ridza bin Dato Seri Setia Haji Abdul Rahman and Chief Executive Officer of Seri Suria Power (B) Sdn Bhd Ravi Bhaskaran.
  The agreements were witnessed by both Pehin Datu Lailaraja Major General (Rtd) Dato Paduka Seri Awang Haji Halbi and Dato Seri Setia Dr Awang Haji Mohd Amin Liew.
  Seri Suria Power (B) Sdn Bhd is a joint-venture company formed by Khazanah Satu Sdn Bhd, a government-linked company, and Serikandi Oilfield Services Sdn Bhd, in partnership with Atlantic Blue Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Solarvest Holdings Berhad, Malaysia.
  The 30MW solar project is expected to significantly boost the country’s renewable energy capacity and support the national target of achieving 30 per cent renewable energy in the total installed capacity mix by 2035.
  This milestone represents Brunei Darussalam’s largest government-led solar project to date and the first large-scale solar initiative under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP). It underscores the nation’s commitment to diversifying its energy mix and pursuing low-carbon development as part of its decarbonisation agenda. – Borneo Bulletin/ANN

From Boo Jia Cher
The transport ministry is captivated by Demand-Responsive Transit (DRT), with 300 new vans set to roll out by June, and Rapid KL expanding its on-demand zones.
A sum of RM55 million has also been set aside for it under the national budget.
While DRT’s flexibility holds appeal, this significant shift risks sidelining the essential work of improving our core bus network – a misstep that could undermine the long-term viability of public transport in Malaysia.
Hidden pitfalls of DRT
DRT may sound innovative, but it suffers from critical drawbacks that make it an unreliable foundation for mass transit in Malaysia.
DRT is unpredictable as it suffers from long, unpredictable wait times, often between 10 and 45 minutes, making it a poor option for daily commuters.
This lack of predictability directly contributes to Malaysians opting for private vehicles, which offer a greater sense of control and a more reliable journey.
While marketed as “direct-to-destination”, DRT instead functions more like a shared taxi than direct transport, with detours and multiple pickups that significantly extend travel time.
The flat RM1 introductory fare is marketed as promotional – will this affordability extend beyond this period? This raises concerns about eventual price hikes, making the model inherently unstable and potentially exclusionary for lower-income riders who depend on affordable transport.
In truth, DRT is being used to mask more systemic issues: insufficient bus routes, underinvestment in high-frequency services, and poor urban planning. It is a short-term workaround, not a long-term fix.
Proven strength of regular buses
Rather than chasing tech-driven novelty, Malaysia should double down on what works: a robust, reliable bus system.
This includes more frequent buses (every 15 minutes or less), better coverage to key areas, dedicated lanes to beat traffic, express routes on highways but with strict enforcement against lane misuse as well as modern fleets with real-time tracking.
These are not revolutionary ideas. They are proven pillars of successful public transport systems worldwide and remain significantly underutilised in Malaysia.
DRT’s role should be in filling the gaps
DRT certainly has its place, but its role should be clearly defined as complementary, not a replacement.
It can be particularly effective in low-density or rural areas, during off-peak or late-night hours, and for meeting specific transport needs, such as accessible services for seniors and persons with disabilities.
Looking ahead, future models could integrate digital booking with informal street-hailing, similar to Indonesia’s angkot or Thailand’s songthaew. This flexible and accessible combination could be powerful, but only if it enhances, rather than replaces, the core bus network.
Don’t get lost on the detour
A successful public transport system depends on reliability, coverage, and affordability, not tech gimmicks.
While DRT offers potential in specific contexts, pouring resources into it at the expense of regular bus services risks weakening the very foundation of urban mobility.
If DRT truly held the key to mass transit, many other developed nations would have adopted it as their primary solution long ago; Malaysia has not suddenly cracked the secret mystery of urban transport.
Malaysia must resist the allure of quick tech-fixes and reinvest in the basics: high-frequency, well-connected, and dependable bus services, and in the long run, better-planned cities.
That’s the most direct path toward livable cities, reduced congestion, lower emissions, and a more equitable future. Let’s put our money where it truly matters.

With Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, producer Kosuke Yabuki said he felt his team at Nintendo reached a finish line.
  In an interview published by the company, members of the developer’s team said they perfected the formula that Nintendo had used since the original, and the team wanted to embark on a new adventure.
  They wanted to bring a bigger scope to the franchise, one where tracks are connected together, but they ran into hardware limitations on the Switch during development. “It was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return,” said programming director Kenta Sato.
  In 'Mario Kart World', players compete against 24 racers and travel on long, winding and complex tracks.
  The game they imagined had difficulty running on a system that came out in 2016, but that problem found a solution with the Nintendo Switch 2. The console’s power allowed the team to create the natural evolution of the series, bringing it into a dazzling, enormous environment. The game was more than just another sequel with a new number. Yabuki said it deserved a new moniker and dubbed it Mario Kart World.
  Open-world via Mario Kart 
  At first glance, the open-world racing game will draw comparisons to the Forza Horizon series, but it doesn’t have that feel. The Nintendo racing game doesn’t have players wandering around a huge space doing quest lines. At its heart, this is still a Mario Kart game, and the fun still lies in chaotic competition.
  In Mario Kart World, players compete against 24 racers and travel on long, winding and complex tracks. Players will drift and toss items at each other so they can move ahead. Rubberbanding is still a factor in the gameplay, with players out front obtaining lower-quality items compared to those running behind, creating comeback opportunities.
  To take advantage of the open world, players drive from one course to the next, giving the eight cups in the Grand Prix a different vibe.
  What’s different, though, is how the open world impacted the track design and competition. The races in Mario Kart World are longer, and they stretch across different environments. Having such long races necessitated a wider competitive field and that created an experience that’s even more riotous, where there’s an equivalent of a Nascar-like crash at every corner.
  The structure also added a new emphasis on tricks. Aside from drifting on corners, players can now Wall Ride, Rail Ride and Charge Jump. These all provide short boosts while also opening up shortcuts for expert drivers. These new skills will take a while to master but they’re vital for success, especially on long straightaways and against computer-controlled opponents who are much sharper and ruthless compared to past games.
  Interconnected racing 
  All of this racing is framed in a new format. To take advantage of the open world, players drive from one course to the next, giving the eight cups in the Grand Prix a different vibe. It feels more natural, like a rally race, as each track transitions into another. It cements the world in players’ imaginations as the environments become less episodic but more of a complete whole.
  Rubberbanding is still a factor in the gameplay, with players out front obtaining lower-quality items compared to those running behind, creating comeback opportunities.
  That unique blending gives Mario Kart World a distinct perspective from open-world racing that’s different from Forza. It also leads to more fantastical track design. The courses in Mario Kart World feel like a Disneyland ride that tells a story with a beginning, middle and end. The pinnacle of this is the new Rainbow Road, which is a transcendent experience for those touching wheels to the technicolour thoroughfare.
  Aside from the Grand Prix, Nintendo also introduced the Knockout Tour, which is a battle royale-type of competition that’s best played online. It pits 24 racers against each other as they go through several segments, and they have to be in the Top 20 in one round, Top 16 the next, until it cuts to the Top 4. Again, the mode takes advantage of the open-world environment while also creating frantic but fun gameplay.
  The last notable mode is the Free Roam, which lets players explore the world that Yabuki and his team crafted. Compared to Forza, Mario Kart World doesn’t have as many activities. Players will run into P Switch challenges that will test their racing skills and teach them techniques they need to become better drivers. They can also collect Peach Coins or regular ones. They’re needed to unlock Stickers and new cars respectively.
  Aside from drifting on corners, players can now Wall Ride, Rail Ride and Charge Jump.
  Sadly, there’s not more that players can do, but the world itself has unbelievable potential with so many variations built into the map. It’s a packed playground and Yabuki and his team will likely have more magic coming down the track. – Bay Area News Group/Tribune News Service

MELAKA: Melaka police have shared an image of a 20-year-old convenience store employee lying dazed and bloodied after being bludgeoned with a baseball bat during a robbery.
  The picture aims to raise public awareness about the growing dangers faced by graveyard shift workers at 24-hour outlets.
  The male victim from Taman Bunga Raya in Bukit Beruang was working the late-night shift at a 24-hour store in Taman Sin Hoe, Bukit Baru, when the lone assailant struck at around 4.40am on Saturday (June 14).
  Melaka Tengah police chief Asst Comm Christopher Patit said the suspect, believed to be a delivery rider, entered the premises wearing a helmet and face mask.
  “The suspect approached the counter under the pretext of requesting an RM50 e-wallet top-up before suddenly grabbing cash from the drawer,” he said late Saturday night.
  ACP Christopher Patit said the employee resisted when the suspect seized RM300, prompting the attacker to strike him on the head with a baseball bat.
  “The victim was rushed to Hospital Melaka with head injuries, and his condition is currently reported as stable,” he added.
  The incident came to light after the store’s supervisor, identified only as "Mr Tong," found the employee in such a condition and alerted authorities.
  The same suspect is believed to be responsible for a second attempted robbery later the same day at another 24-hour outlet in Taman Saujana Puri in Bukit Katil.
  "In that incident, the suspect used a similar modus operandi by pretending to request an e-wallet top-up.
  “When the 31-year-old male cashier attempted to return the change, the suspect reached into the cash drawer and, when the employee tried to intervene, struck him on the wrist with a camera tripod," he said.
  The suspect fled on a motorcycle, and the cashier sustained minor injuries.
  Both cases are being investigated under Section 394 of the Penal Code for causing hurt in the course of committing robbery.
  “We have obtained the suspect’s fingerprint from one of the locations and are confident of arresting him soon,” he added.
  This is not the first time 24-hour retail outlets in Melaka have been targeted.
  In August 2023, Melaka police arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with a spree of 20 break-ins involving petrol station convenience stores across Johor, Negeri Sembilan, and Melaka.
  The suspect used tools to smash glass doors and steal cash and goods worth thousands of ringgit.
  In July 2021, a 48-year-old woman was detained following a series of smash-and-grab burglaries at petrol station convenience stores in the Melaka Tengah district.
  
------------------------------
MELAKA, June 15 — Two employees at 24-hour convenience stores were injured in separate incidents involving robbery and attempted robbery here early yesterday morning.
  In a statement, Melaka Tengah police chief ACP Christopher Patit said the first incident occurred at around 4.40 am in Taman Sin Hoe, Bukit Baru. A 20-year-old worker, who was alone at the time, sustained head injuries after being struck with a suspected baseball bat wrapped in black cloth.
  The attacker, described as wearing a helmet and face mask, approached the counter asking for an RM50 e-wallet top-up before grabbing the cash drawer. A struggle ensued, during which the victim was assaulted. The suspect fled with approximately RM300.
  The victim was taken to Melaka Hospital and is in stable condition.
  In the second incident, around the same time in Saujana Puri, Bukit Katil, a man dressed as a food delivery rider entered another store and also requested an e-wallet top-up.
  “When the 31-year-old cashier attempted to return the change, the suspect reached into the cash drawer. The victim intervened and was struck on the wrist with a metal object, believed to be part of a tripod,” said Christopher.
  The suspect fled on a Yamaha LC motorcycle with a food delivery box. No money was taken, though the employee sustained minor injuries.
  Both cases are being investigated under Section 394 of the Penal Code for causing hurt in the course of committing robbery. — Bernama

SIGN language interpreting in hospitals is not the same as in conferences or meetings.
  There are no slides, no prepared scripts – just people, symptoms and unfamiliar words.
  It’s a task that requires proper training – one that Jonah Ong, an interpreter from the Interpreters and Translators Association for Selangor and Kuala Lumpur Deaf Community (JUPEBIM), is now better equipped to handle, thanks to a course he completed earlier this year.
  Designed by IMU Cares – the Community Engagement and Sustainability office at IMU University – together with JUPEBIM, the Medical Basics for Sign Language Interpreters course aims to bridge communication gaps between doctors and Deaf patients.
  “Normally, we use sign language that Deaf people understand in daily life. But in a medical setting, spelling out a disease name or medication isn’t enough. We have to use visual vernacular and facial expressions to show where the surgical cut would be and how the brain sits in the skull,” Ong told StarEdu.
  The course – launched in November last year, with the first cycle concluding in January and the next one commencing this September – focuses on medical terms, medications and diseases, he said.
  “We had a Deaf guest lecturer from overseas teaching us ways to show concepts in 3D using signs, classifiers and expressions. That really opened my eyes,” he shared.
  Following the completion of the first cycle, interpreters like Ong have been actively interpreting for Deaf patients receiving complimentary consultations and treatment at IMU Healthcare clinics.
  They were also on hand to provide assistance to Deaf individuals who attended the IMU Deaf Aware and Ready Health Carnival in February, where services such as dental screening, chiropractic clinics and traditional Chinese medicine consultations were offered.
  “As interpreters, we have to understand our Deaf clients. When scheduled to meet a Deaf patient, we arrive early and have ‘small talk’ first – to get to know them, especially if it’s a Deaf child or an elderly Deaf person. That helps when it comes to meeting the doctor and understanding the medical history,” said Ong, who has 20 years of experience in the field.
  He added that interpreters must also draw on their creativity.
  “Doctors try to find out how the pain feels – burning, poking, dull – and rate it from one to 10. But many Deaf patients may not know how to express this clearly. So we get creative: asking the children if the pain is big or small, or frowning deeply with our eyes to show how severe the pain is,” he explained.
  JUPEBIM president Lucy Lim, who interprets not only at IMU clinics but also in hospitals and other clinics, added that interpreters must be assertive and composed, especially in emotionally charged situations.
  “For example, when you interpret the words ‘You have stage four cancer’, you will see the Deaf person in shock or in tears. But it’s our role to stay grounded, to interpret faithfully without becoming emotional or showing our expressions,” she said.
  According to Adibah Hakimi, student lead of the project, the course curriculum covers human anatomy, common conditions across specialties, and even ethics in medicine, while a medical signing book developed by IMU students serves as a study tool for interpreters before the final assessment in the course.
  “We wrote the book as a side quest to the course. We had 25 writers consisting of third- and fourth-year students, as well as fresh graduates, working on the chapters alongside faculty members.
  “Prof Dr Suneet Sood, our deputy head of surgery, did the majority of the work like illustration editing, while I helped to ensure we did not fall behind schedule. Editors of the book include Assoc Prof Dr Ismail Abdul Sattar Burud, Dr Nabeel Ibraheem Jaafar, Prof Suneet and me. It is the first book published by IMU Cares, complete with an ISBN number,” she said.
  She also shared that Prof Suneet, who is currently working on volume two of the book, will be presenting the project at the 1st World Association of Sign Language Interpreters Asia Conference 2025 in Kuala Lumpur in August.
  As part of the varsity’s ongoing Deaf Aware and Ready (DeAR) initiative, the next cycle of the Medical Basics for Sign Language Interpreters course – open to anyone able to interpret Malaysian Sign Language – will run for 16 weeks starting in September.
  Since its inception in 2020, the DeAR initiative – born out of the challenges brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic and led by IMU Community Engagement and Sustainability dean Prof Dr Khoo Suan Phaik – has reached over 500 Deaf individuals through various programmes across the varsity’s four campuses.
  Over 150 IMU students have engaged in experiential learning opportunities focused on patient-centred care, and more than 145 students have completed basic sign language training.
  Building on the success of the inaugural Medical Basics for Sign Language Interpreters course, the varsity is expanding the programme to welcome more interpreters, including those from neighbouring countries.
  Prof Khoo said the varsity’s journey towards becoming a Deaf-aware and Deaf-ready institution reflects a broader call to action for all Malaysians.
  “We have made meaningful progress through Deaf awareness activities and collaborations with Deaf schools to enhance digital literacy, health access, and supportive learning environments.
  “But inclusivity is not the work of one institution alone – it is a shared responsibility,” she concluded.

  With the theme of the article in mind, carry out the following english language activities.
  1 Work in pairs. One is the “patient”, the other the “doctor”. The patient picks a symptom (e.g., headache, stomachache, dizziness) and describes it using only facial expressions and gestures. The doctor writes a full English sentence about the symptom observed. Swap roles and repeat with a different symptom. Afterwards, discuss how it felt to communicate non- verbally and how interpreters help in such situations.
  2 If you had the chance to attend basic sign language training, would you sign up? Why or why not? Turn your response into a short persuasive paragraph encouraging others to learn sign language.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim last night pledged his support for the establishment of a national sepak takraw academy by the end of this year, during the National Youth Day celebrations at Dataran Merdeka.
  He said Youth and Sports Minister Hannah Yeoh had requested RM6 million to develop the academy, and while acknowledging the sizeable amount, he said the government would try to allocate the funds, recognising the sport’s potential to grow in popularity.
  “Sepak takraw has gained great recognition, not just locally but internationally. Almost every village plays the sport, and it is deeply rooted in our culture. I support the proposal for a national academy and will ensure it becomes a reality,” said Anwar.
  Despite the steep funding request, he said the project would move forward soon.
  Anwar also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to youth development through Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), noting the increasing interest in the field with nearly 500,000 enrolled students and 140,000 new applicants this year alone.
  With major tech conglomerates such as Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia establishing operations in Malaysia, Anwar said these companies were drawn not only by strong government policies but also by the country’s talented youth.
  “These companies tell me our economy is stable, but the real reason they are here is because of our youth. Their work ethic and commitment are what attract investments,” he said to rapturous applause.
  He added that the Madani government is also taking steps to raise wages and ensure fair pay, especially for young workers in government-linked companies.
  “We don’t just talk — we act. Salary reforms, public responsibility schemes, and job creation efforts are all designed with youth in mind,” he said.
  In closing, Anwar reiterated the government’s zero-tolerance policy on corruption and urged young people to stay vigilant against political manipulation and divisive rhetoric.
  The National Youth Day celebration is taking place at Dataran Merdeka until today.

PETALING JAYA: The development of sepak takraw in the country got a massive boost after getting RM6 million in funds to upgrade existing facilities and form their own Malaysian Sepak Takraw Academy.
  The facilities in question are on land owned by the National Sports Institute (NSI), and have been leased to Malaysian Sepak Takraw Association to upgrade.
  Youth and Sports Minister Hannah Yeoh thanked Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, who allocated the additional funding for the sport’s development on Saturday.
  "I would like to thank the Prime Minister as I didn’t expect the RM6 million to be approved," she said after the HKL Fun Run event yesterday.
  Hannah said the sport’s additional development comes at the right time as interest in sepak takraw has been on the rise, alongside recent achievements from the national team on the world stage.
  Malaysia brought back three bronze medals from this year’s World Cup in India in March, and recently took two gold and one silver at the Asian Cup here in Kuala Lumpur last month.
  "We know that the sport is growing in interest among Malaysians, and it is also a traditional sport.
  "They have been performing well, so the association wrote to us requesting that the Prime Minister, as Finance Minister, provide additional funds to upgrade facilities to become an academy," she said.
  "It’s a good partnership because the Ministry do not intend to build academies or stadiums for all 103 sports in the country. We can’t afford it all.
  "It’s a government facility and would not be a loss to upgrade it for a popular sport like sepak takraw.
  "But this additional funding does come with terms, and I will be discussing it with the association soon.
  "The Prime Minister wants to make this academy a reality by the end of the year," she said.

KUALA PILAH, June 15 (Bernama) -- A total of RM1 million has been allocated to upgrade Kampung Parit Seberang, which has been selected as the Inspector-General of Police’s (IGP) Kampung Angkat MADANI (MADANI Adopted Village).
  Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain said that the village was selected by the Bukit Aman Crime Prevention and Community Safety Department (JPJKK), based on its infrastructure status, which was assessed to be below 50 per cent complete, and in need of special attention.
  He said that the Kampung Parit Seberang Village Development and Security Committee (JPKK) encompasses three villages - Kampung Parit Mainau, Kampung Parit Mungkal and Kampung Parit Istana - covering a total area of 3.3 square kilometres.
  “I would like to share that RM1 million has been allocated, through the Ministry of Finance, to support the entire initiative to upgrade the village, not to mention, omak sey oghang sini (my mother is from here),” he said.
  He added that, beyond narrowing the development gap in basic infrastructure between rural and urban areas, the programme aims to deliver high-quality community services, through collaboration between ministries, departments, agencies, and public universities.
  He said this at the IGP’s MADANI Adopted Village community programme, held in Kampung Parit Seberang, which was also attended by state senior executive councillor, Datuk Seri Jalaluddin Alias, here, today.
  Razarudin said the proposed upgrade projects include improvements to buildings, landscaping and fencing around the Kampung Parit Seberang surau, road repairs and resurfacing, refurbishment of the Kampung Parit Seberang community hall, and the installation of 20 solar-powered street lights throughout the village.
  He added that the upgrading works are being closely monitored by the Bukit Aman JPJKK and the Kuala Pilah district police headquarters (IPD), with the aim of ensuring that all improvements are implemented with good governance.
  “I have high hopes that this government initiative will be put to good use, for the comfort and well-being of the local community,” he said.
  Meanwhile, Kampung Parit Seberang JPKK chairman Hasnan Abd Malek, 55, expressed his gratitude to the government for selecting the village as the IGP’s MADANI Adopted Village.
  “This selection is a great advantage in our aim to achieve zero crime. Alhamdulillah, it will bring many benefits to the villagers, especially in terms of security, as there will now be regular police patrols in the village,” he said.

Many of the protests are taking place under the theme ‘No Kings’, asserting that no one is above the law. (AP pic)
WASHINGTON
:
Tens of thousands of Americans protested president Donald Trump at rallies and marches in major cities from New York to Los Angeles yesterday, a day marred by the assassination of a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota and conflict in the Middle East.
The protests marked the largest outpouring of opposition to Trump’s presidency since he returned to power in January, and came the same day that thousands of military personnel, vehicles and aircraft will march through and fly over Washington, DC, in a parade celebrating the US army’s 250th anniversary.
Yesterday was also Trump’s 79th birthday.
National guard troops and US marines are also in Los Angeles, having been ordered there by Trump to secure the heavily Democratic city amid protests over his immigration policies – a deployment that California governor Gavin Newsom has challenged in court.
Meanwhile, Israel yesterday pounded Iran with a second barrage of strikes in a bid to destroy its nuclear programme after Iran retaliated with strikes the evening before, stoking fears of a mushrooming conflict between the two nations.
Anti-Trump groups planned nearly 2,000 demonstrations across the country to coincide with the parade.
Many are taking place under the theme “No Kings”, asserting that no individual is above the law.
All planned “No Kings” protests in Minnesota were cancelled following what Democratic Minnesota governor Tim Walz said was the “politically motivated assassination” of one Democratic lawmaker and wounding of a second.
Authorities in Minnesota said that flyers promoting the protests were found in the suspected gunman’s car.
A massive manhunt was underway.
Trump condemned the shootings, saying in a social media post: “Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America.”
The Texas department of public safety said in a statement it had identified a credible threat against state lawmakers planning to attend a protest yesterday, and had evacuated the state capitol and its grounds.
People in Washington for the parade encountered a massive security presence, with some 30km of 2.4m-high black fencing, much of it reinforced with concrete traffic barriers, cordoning off streets and surrounding landmarks including the Washington Monument.
The celebrations will cost the US army between US$25 million and US$45 million, US officials have told Reuters.
That includes the parade itself as well as the cost of moving equipment and housing and feeding the troops.
Critics have called the parade an authoritarian display of power that is wasteful, especially given Trump has said he wants to slash costs throughout the federal government.
‘Disgusting display’

In downtown Los Angeles, several thousand protesters began marching, packed shoulder to shoulder and stretching along nearly a dozen city blocks.
The protest was peaceful at midday.
American flags, many flown upside down, far outnumbered the Mexican flags at the rally.
Erika Rice, 46, said she was moved to attend her first protest because of Trump’s decision to use the military to assist ICE on immigration raids and to protect federal buildings in her city.
“Using the military here is a disgusting displaying of trying to wield power over the American people and over immigrants,” Rice said.
Despite rain, thousands of people of all ages turned out in and around Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan, many carrying homemade signs that played off the “No Kings” theme.
“No crown for a clown,” said one.
Actor Mark Ruffalo was among the demonstrators, wearing a hat that read “immigrant”.
“We’re seeing dehumanising language towards LGBT people, towards people with autism, towards people with other disabilities, racial minorities, undocumented people,” said Cooper Smith, 20, from upstate New York.
“Somebody’s got to show that most Americans are against this.”
Thousands packed Chicago’s Daley Plaza and surrounding streets yesterday under the iconic Picasso statue.
Some chanted “Lock him up!” in reference to the president.
Allan Hallie, a 70-year-old retired gastroenterologist, travelled from the northwest Indiana town of Ogden Dunes to protest policies of the Trump administration.
“I am quite afraid of the direction of this country,” he said.
Members of the far-right Proud Boys, ardent Trump supporters, appeared at an Atlanta “No Kings” protest, wearing the group’s distinctive black and yellow colours.
About 400 protesters, organised by a group called RefuseFascism.org, marched through Washington and gathered for a rally in a park opposite the White House.
Trump had warned people against protesting at the parade itself, saying that “they’re going to be met with very big force.”
Sunsara Taylor, a founder of RefuseFascism, told the crowd, “Today we refuse to accept Donald Trump unleashing the military against the people of this country and in the streets of this country. We say, ‘hell no.'”
Rare spectacle
Military parades in the US are rare.
Other countries usually stage them to celebrate victories in battle or showcase military might.
In 1991, tanks and thousands of troops paraded through Washington to celebrate the ousting of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait in the Gulf War.
Thousands of agents, officers and specialists will be deployed from law enforcement agencies from across the country and drones operated by the secret service will keep watch overhead.
The US army has brought nearly 7,000 troops into Washington, along with 150 vehicles, including more than 25 M1 Abrams tanks, 28 Stryker armoured vehicles, four Paladin self-propelled artillery vehicles, and artillery pieces including the M777 and M119.
The flyover will include Apache and Black Hawk helicopters along with Chinooks.
Older aircraft like the World War II-era B-25 bomber and P-51 Mustang will also take part.

PHILADELPHIA: Masses of demonstrators packed into streets, parks and plazas across the U.S. on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump, marching through downtowns and small towns, blaring anti-authoritarian chants mixed with support for protecting democracy and immigrant rights.
  Organizers of the "No Kings” demonstrations said millions had marched in hundreds of events. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering.
  Confrontations were isolated. But police in Los Angeles, where protests over federal immigration enforcement raids erupted a week earlier and sparked demonstrations across the country, used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the formal event ended.
  Huge, boisterous crowds marched, danced, drummed, and chanted shoulder-to-shoulder in New York, Denver, Chicago, Austin and Los Angeles, some behind "no kings” banners. Atlanta’s 5,000-capacity event quickly reached its limit, with thousands more gathered outside barriers to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol.
  Trump was in Washington for a military parade marking the Army’s 250th anniversary that coincides with the president’s birthday. About 200 protesters assembled in northwest Washington’s Logan Circle and chanted "Trump must go now” before erupting in cheers. A larger-than-life puppet of Trump - a caricature of the president wearing a crown and sitting on a golden toilet - was wheeled through the crowd.
  In some places, organizers handed out little American flags while others flew their flags upside down, a sign of distress.
  Mexican flags, which have become a fixture of the Los Angeles protests against immigration raids, also made an appearance at some demonstrations Saturday.
  In Culpepper, Virginia, police said one person was struck by an SUV when a 21-year-old driver intentionally accelerated his SUV into the crowd as protesters were leaving a rally. The driver was charged with reckless driving.
  The demonstrations come on the heels of the protests over the federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire.
  "Today, across red states and blue, rural towns and major cities, Americans stood in peaceful unity and made it clear: we don’t do kings," the No Kings Coalition said in a statement on Saturday afternoon after many events had ended.
  Thousands gathered downtown, where organizers handed out small American flags and people carried protest signs saying "fight oligarchy” and "deport the mini-Mussolinis."
  Karen Van Trieste, a 61-year-old nurse who drove up from Maryland, said she grew up in Philadelphia and wanted to be with a large group of people showing her support.
  "I just feel like we need to defend our democracy,” she said. She is concerned about the Trump administration’s layoffs of staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fate of immigrant communities and Trump trying to rule by executive order, she said.
  A woman wearing a foam Statue of Liberty crown brought a speaker system and led an anti-Trump sing-along, changing the words "young man” in the song "Y.M.C.A.” to "con man.”
  ”I am what the successful American dream looks like,” said C.C. Téllez, an immigrant from Bolivia who attended the protest. "I’ve enjoyed great success here in the United States, and I’ve also contributed heavily to my community. And if there was space for me, I think there’s a way for everybody else to belong here as well.”
  Thousands gathered in front of City Hall, waving signs and listening to a Native American drum circle before marching through the streets.
  As protesters passed National Guard troops or U.S. Marines stationed at various buildings, most interactions were friendly, with demonstrators giving fist bumps or posing for selfies. But others chanted "shame” or "go home” at the troops.
  Amid signs reading "They fear us don’t back down California” and "We carry dreams not danger, ” one demonstrator carried a 2-foot-tall (60-centimeter) Trump pinata on a stick, with a crown on his head and sombrero hanging off his back. Another hoisted a huge helium-filled orange baby balloon with blond hair styled like Trump's.
  A few blocks from City Hall, protesters gathered in front of the downtown federal detention center being guarded by a line of Marines and other law enforcement. It was the first time that the Marines, in combat gear and holding rifles, have appeared at a demonstration since they were deployed to city on Friday with the stated mission of defending federal property.
  Peter Varadi, 54, said he voted for Trump last November for "economic reasons.” Now, for the first time in his life, he is protesting, waving a Mexican and U.S. combined flag.
  "I voted for Donald Trump, and now I regret that, because he’s taken this fascism to a new level,” Varadi said. "It’s Latinos now. Who’s next? It’s gays. Blacks after that. They’re coming for everybody.”
  Even after the formal event ended, the downtown streets were packed with a jubilant crowd as people danced to salsa music and snacked on hot dogs and ice cream bought from vendors, many of whom are Latino immigrants. But the previously calm demonstration turned confrontational as police on horseback moved into the crowd and struck some people with wood rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building.
  Marchers in the crowd that stretched for blocks along Fifth Avenue had diverse reasons for coming, including anger over Trump’s immigration policies, support for the Palestinian people and outrage over what they said was an erosion of free speech rights.
  But there were patriotic symbols, too. Leah Griswold, 32, and Amber Laree, 59, who marched in suffragette white dresses, brought 250 American flags to hand out to people in the crowd.
  "Our mothers who came out, fought for our rights, and now we're fighting for future generations as well,” Griswold said.
  Some protesters held signs denouncing Trump while others banged drums.
  "We’re here because we’re worried about the existential crisis of this country and the planet and our species,” said Sean Kryston, 28.
  Gov. Tim Walz and law enforcement encouraged people not to attend rallies "out of an abundance of caution” following the shootings of the Democratic state lawmakers.
  Dozen of events were canceled, but tens of thousands still turned out for demonstrations in Duluth, Rochester and St. Paul, which included a march to the state Capitol. Walz canceled his scheduled appearance at the St. Paul event.
  Authorities said the suspect had "No Kings” flyers in his car and writings mentioning the names of the victims as well as other lawmakers and officials, though they could not say if he had any other specific targets.
  Seda Heng, 29, of Rochester, said she was heartbroken by the shootings, but still wanted to join the rally there. "These people are trying to do what they can for their communities, for the state, for the nation,” Heng told the Minnesota Star-Tribune.
  Crowds cheered anti-Trump speakers in Charlotte's First Ward Park before marching, chanting "No kings. No crowns. We will not bow down."
  Marchers stretched for blocks, led by a group of people holding a giant Mexican flag and bystanders cheering and clapping along the way.
  Jocelyn Abarca, a 21-year-old college student, said the protest was a chance to "speak for what’s right” after mass deportations and Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles.
  "If we don’t stop it now, it’s just going to keep getting worse,” she said.
  Naomi Mena said she traveled an hour to demonstrate in Charlotte to represent her "friends and family who sadly can’t have a voice out in public now” to stay safe.
  A rally at the Texas Capitol in Austin went off as planned despite state police briefly shutting down the building and the surrounding grounds after authorities said they received a "credible threat” to Democratic state lawmakers who were to attend.
  Dozens of state troopers swarmed through the grounds about four hours before the event, but the area was later opened and the rally started on time. The building remained closed.
  The Department of Public Safety later said one person was taken into custody "in connection with the threats made against state lawmakers" after a traffic stop in La Grange, Texas, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Austin. State police did not detail the threat or immediately identify the person, but said there was no additional active threat.
  A demonstration of hundreds of people opened to "War Pigs” by Black Sabbath playing over a sound system on the state Capitol lawn in Jackson.
  "A lot of stuff that’s going on now is targeting people of color, and to see so many folks out here that aren’t black or brown fighting for the same causes that I’m here for, it makes me very emotional,” said Tony Cropper, who traveled from Tennessee to attend the protest.
  Some people wore tinfoil crowns atop their heads. Others held signs inviting motorists to "Honk if you never text war plans.”
  Melissa Johnson said she drove an hour-and-a-half to Jackson to protest because "we are losing the thread of democracy in our country." - AP

特朗普
长久以来梦寐以够的军事
阅兵
于当地时间周六傍晚（马来西亚时间 星期日上午）在华盛顿市中心隆重登场，庆祝美国陆军建军250周年。不过，这场庆典却笼灵罩在暴力与社会分裂的阴影下！
路透社报道，在阅兵开始的数小时前，数十万美国民众已涌上纽约、芝加哥、洛杉矶街头，
抗议
特朗普的施政。当天稍早，明尼苏达两名民主党议员遭到枪手暗杀，酿成一死一伤悲剧，嫌凶仍在逃。

另外，以色列周六也对伊朗发动第二波空袭，试图摧毁核计划设施。前一天，伊朗的反击行动，已让两国之间的冲突风险急剧升高，引发国际关切。在这一连串事件之前是洛杉矶为期一周的紧张局势。联邦移民当局的突袭行动引发抗议，特朗普动用国民兵和陆战队进驻。
尽管如此，特朗普的阅兵仍在星期日庆祝79岁生日当天举行，因华府天气预报将有雷阵雨，时间比原定提前。
数以千计观众聚集在靠近国家广场的宪法大道沿线，阅兵以铜管乐队揭开序幕。特朗普坐在高台上检阅队伍，出场时受到支持者欢呼。特朗普一直渴望在美国举行类似其他国家的军事阅兵，这在美国历史上极为罕见。上次大规模阅兵是在1991年，庆祝在波斯湾战争中将伊拉克总统沙旦胡先的军队赶出科威特。

这次阅兵出动近7000名士兵、150辆军车，包括25辆M1艾布兰（M1 Abrams）坦克、28辆斯特莱克（Stryker）装甲车、4辆圣骑士（Paladin）自走炮和多种榴弹炮例如M777和M119。美国官员透露，阅兵与相关开支，包含装备运输、士兵食宿总计2500万美元（1.05亿令吉）至4500万美元（1.9亿令吉）之间。
批评人士认为，这场阅兵是炫耀武力的“威权表演”，与特朗普所提倡的政府开支紧缩政策自相矛盾。支持特朗为的民众亨利从得州飞来华府参加活动，对于战车上街毫不反感。61岁的他说：“我不觉得这有什么争议，与其混乱无序，我更愿意选择安全与稳定。”
然而，之前，大批民众涌上华府与全美其他城市街头抗议特朗普政策，抗议大致上和平进行，是特朗普今年初重返白宫以来最大规模的反对声浪。美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）报道，预料全美各地将有数百万人上街抗议特朗普。反特朗普团体策划将近2000场同步示威，主题是“不要国王”（No Kings），强调无人能凌驾法律之上。
原定在明尼苏达举行的“不要国王”抗议行动全数取消，民主党州长沃尔兹表示，民主党议员默丽莎霍特曼因政治动机遭到暗杀，另一名议员约翰霍夫曼也受伤。
在洛杉矶大批示威民众聚集在市中心罗伊博联邦大楼前，与部署的陆战队对峙。这里日前爆发抗争者与警察的冲突。群众与陆战队仅相隔3公尺，他们大声齐喊：“可耻！可耻！”、“陆战队滚出洛杉矶！”
参加“拒绝法西斯”（RefuseFascism.org）组织的400名示威者在华府游行，并在白宫对面公园集会。特朗普事先警告不要在阅兵现场示威，否则“将遭遇强力反制。”
“拒绝法西斯”创办人桑沙拉泰勒在集会上对群众说：“我们今天拒绝接受特朗普将军队用来对付人民、出现在街头。我们说，绝不接受！”

这场阅兵式旨在纪念美国陆军成立，也是特朗普79岁的生日。
光在纽约，就在数以万计民众穿着雨衣、撑着各色雨伞在鼓声、铃声和人们高呼：“嘿，嘿，噢，噢，特朗普必须下台！”的呐喊声中，在倾盆大雨中沿着第五大道（Fifth Avenue）游行。
好莱坞女星苏珊莎兰登和男星马克鲁法洛，也出现在抗议人群中，全身湿透。
至于在洛杉矶也爆发了大规模的“不要国王”抗议活动。洛杉矶近日因为抗议特朗普政府镇压移民爆发抗争，甚至连守法的无证人士也遭到联邦探员残忍逮捕。
在特朗普违背洛杉矶和加州当局意愿，派遗4000名国民兵和700名美国海军陆战队员进驻洛杉矶之后，抗议人士周六聚集在这座城市的联邦大厦前，对着部分士兵高喊“你们在此不受欢迎！”。

（盐湖城15日综合电）周六在美国犹他州盐湖城市中心举行的“不要国王”游行现场约有1万人参加，然而在游行期间爆发枪响，按照《BNO》新闻发布的现场影片，当时至少传出3声枪响，众人窜逃。
《KUTV》报道，当众人在先锋公园（Pioneer Garden）和联邦大楼之间游行的时间，南州街200号附近发生枪击事件。影片显示，在3声枪击后，现场群众开始奔跑，可听见有人高呼“天啊，那是枪”、“快离开这里！”

多个执法单位与多辆救护车赶到现场，当局要求示威者安全有序离开。警方说， 事件造成1人伤势危急，“我们已在这里部署多个执法单位，在试着核实相关消息并确认是否有受害人。”
事发后不久，州长斯潘塞科克斯说，这起枪击事件“令人深感不安”。
他说：“今晚盐湖城抗议活动中发生的枪击事件是一起令人深感不安的暴力行为，不应该出现在我们的公共场所，目前情况仍在持续，我们在与执法部门密切合作，确保追究责任。”
盐湖城市长艾林门登霍尔也对事件发表评论，声称人们在行使第一修正案赋予的权利时应该感到安全。
“我们今天在盐湖城和美国其他地方看到的暴力事件令人震惊–这根本不符合我们的本性。感谢盐湖城警察局今晚迅速采取行动，保护生命安全和支持和平游行的人们。盐湖城警察局，我的心与你们同在。我们一定能度过难关。”
这次抗议活动是犹他州发生近12起抗议活动中，规模最大的一次。

特朗普
当地时间周六在其79岁生日当天，出席了他梦寐以求的军事
阅兵
式，坦克、军队和21响礼炮齐鸣。与此同时，而全美各地的示威者则在他重新掌权以来最大规模的抗议活动中将他称为独裁者。
这位共和党总统当时坐在白宫以南的一个特别观景台上，观看美国军事力量的展示。随着小雨和乌云笼罩华盛顿纪念碑，阅兵式开始得很早，然后匆匆结束。2017年，特朗普在巴黎出席了阅兵式后，他试图在第一个任期内让6000多名士兵和128辆陆军坦克参加游行，但这些计划一直没有实现，直到将游行加入到美国陆军建军250周年的纪念活动中。

在见到坦克、飞机和军队从他身边呼啸而过后，特朗普称赞美国是“世界上最火热的国家”。

在阅兵式上，美国历史上不同时期的军队和军事装备经过，播音员滔滔不绝地讲述着过去战争中与日本、德国、中国和越南军队的战斗胜利。
特朗普在阅兵致辞中向对手发出“彻底”失败的警告，时值美国越来越有可能卷入以色列与伊朗的冲突。
他放话：“美国的敌人一次又一次地认识到，如果你威胁美国人民，我们的士兵就会来找你。”
特朗普在阅兵结束时发表简短讲话时说道：“每个国家都在庆祝他们的胜利。美国也该庆祝胜利了。”
他赞扬了美军战斗部队的实力，并表示美军“战斗、战斗、战斗，他们赢、赢”——这番话是对特朗普在2024年竞选集会上经常说的一句话的全新诠释，此前特朗普在一次暗杀中幸存下来。
在当晚的盛大阅兵仪式上，陆军金骑士跳伞队从阴云密布的天空中缓缓降落，向检阅台飞去。跳伞队原定压轴登场，但由于国家广场上空细雨蒙蒙，他们比计划提前开始。
特朗普不时在美军列队经过检阅台时起立敬礼。但出席人数似乎远低于最初预测的20万人参加此次节日和游行。华盛顿纪念碑附近的观众之间出现了很大的空隙，而当天闷热的天气和雷暴的威胁可能会影响到出席人数。
游行开始前几个小时，示威者走上全国各地的街道和公园，向特朗普发出抗议。他们批评特朗普动用军队来促成这场在美国首都举行的军事秀。
这场游行是两个月前才加入到筹划已久的陆军建军纪念日庆祝活动中的，因其高达4500万美元（约1.9兆令吉）的费用以及笨重的坦克可能摧毁城市街道而受到批评。陆军已采取措施保护街道，包括沿途铺设金属板。
约有六成美国人认为阅兵式“没有好好利用”政府资金。一项民调显示，绝大多数人（78%）表示，他们总体上对这次游行既不赞成也不反对。
游行队伍沿着宪法大道蜿蜒而行，两旁是安全围栏和路障。参加阅兵式的飞机包括二战时期的飞机，包括B-25米切尔轰炸机，军用直升机在人群中低空飞行，低于华盛顿纪念碑的顶部。来自第一骑兵师的骑兵也亮相。战马曾经在战争中扮演着至关重要的角色，但如今它们主要用于像今天的游行这样的仪式活动。
特朗普主持了250名陆军新兵入伍宣誓仪式。他对他们说：“欢迎加入美国军队！并拥有美好的生活。”
乡村音乐歌手扎德斯和演唱《上帝保佑美国》的歌手格林伍德都参加了演出。这次活动以烟火表演画上句点。
由于天公不作美，美国空军战机出场的环节似乎被取消了。
当人群唱着“生日快乐”时，偶尔也有人高呼“USA！USA！”，但现场气氛远不及特朗普上台时那场声势浩大的集会。
白宫方面称“超过25万爱国者”参加了此次活动，但没有提供任何证据。白宫通讯总监史蒂文·张将“反国王”抗议活动描述为“彻底的失败”。

（华盛顿15日美联电）特朗普周六见证美国陆军实力之际，他已展现出愿意动用国家军事力量的意愿，而其他美国总统通常会避免这种做法。上周，他启动并派遣美国海军陆战队在洛杉矶与移民突袭相关的抗议活动中提供安保，此举引发了一项州政府喊告，要求停止部署军队。
当装甲车在总统面前的街道上驶过时，另一厢，特朗普部署到洛杉矶的海军陆战队首次出现在示威活动中，在一座联邦大楼外站岗。数十名海军陆战队员全副武装，与国民警卫队、国土安全部官员和其他执法人员并肩站在一起。数百名抗议者朝他们叫嚣，要求他们“滚回家”。

洛杉矶市中心原本平静的示威活动突然变得混乱，骑警冲向人群，在清理联邦大楼前的街道时，用警棍和棍棒殴打一些人，并发射催泪弹和闪光弹。
在华盛顿，数百名抗议特朗普的民众举着标语向白宫行进，标语上写着“正当程序在哪里？”和“拒绝特朗普的法西斯军事游行”等口号。

其他抗议者挥舞着彩虹旗帜，高举标语，其中一些标语上写着尖锐的口号，例如“我更喜欢碎冰”（ICE），指的是美国移民和海关执法局（ICE）。其他口号还包括“入侵发生在1月6日而不是洛杉矶”和“如果你是法西斯分子，就对我竖中指”。
“无国王”的组织者表示，抗议者聚集在数百个城市，法新社记者在多个城市看到了大批人群。
组织者表示，他们抗议的是特朗普的独裁统治，尤其是他们所说的游行中所体现的强人象征。
28岁的音乐家罗斯在纽约告诉法新社：“我觉得大家都疯了”，当时有数万人参加了集会。
一些抗议者瞄准了特朗普位于佛州棕榈滩的马阿拉歌庄园，甚至还有一小群抗议者聚集在法国巴黎。
42岁的抗议者哈格雷夫在华盛顿郊区贝塞斯达说道：“我觉得这太恶心了”。她将特朗普的阅兵式描述为“威权主义的展示”。
暴力事件也打破了其他地方的平静。据警方称，在美国西部城市盐湖城的一场示威活动中发生枪击事件，造成至少一人重伤。
周六，在北部明尼苏达州，一名民主党议员及其丈夫被杀害。州长沃尔兹称这是一起有针对性的袭击，也给阅兵蒙上了一层阴影。
特朗普迅速谴责了明尼阿波利斯郊外发生的袭击事件，前州议长霍特曼和她的丈夫在袭击中丧生，另一位州议员和他的妻子因枪伤住院。

美国陆军士兵在华盛顿举行的陆军建军250周年阅兵式上列队行进。（法新社照片）
（华盛顿15日综合电）美国华府周六举办
阅兵仪式
，盛大庆祝陆军建军250周年，当天适逢美国总统特朗普生日。活动吸引大批民众到场观看，有人认为，250周年是“重大时刻，不论花费多少”，都应该要庆祝，也有民众举着标语到场表达反对意见。
美国陆军建军250周年纪念活动今年加码在华府宪法大道举行阅兵仪式，当天也是特朗普79岁大寿。除了阅兵仪式，当天在华府国家广场还有烟火秀。
ADVERTISEMENT
由于华府天气不佳，傍晚开始飘雨，阅兵仪式比原定时间提早半小时，出动数千名士兵列队行进，多架军用直升机飞越天空，还有陆军伞兵从军机跳伞着陆。
美媒指出，这是自1991年首次波湾战争结束以来，在美国首都举行最大规模的阅兵仪式。约有150辆军用车辆、6600名士兵，以及数十架军机在阅兵仪式登场，呈现美国陆军发展史的各个重要时期。
美国陆军指出，参与阅兵仪式的武器装备包括M1A2艾布拉姆斯坦克、UH-60黑鹰（Black Hawk）直升机、AH-64阿帕契直升机、CH-47契努克（Chinook）直升机，以及海马士多管火箭系统（HIMARS）。
另外还有无人机、机器狗的先进装备。
特朗普在致词中表示，“美军让我们得以自由，你们让我们坚强。如果你威胁美国人民，我们的士兵就会来找你。你的失败是注定的…因为我们的士兵从不放弃、绝不投降…。”
这场阅兵活动因花费高昂、观感的问题而招致不少批评，华府阅兵式当天，全美各地民众也串联举行多场“不要国王”（No Kings）抗议活动。
不过，这场阅兵式仍吸引大批民众到场观看，有人下午到场举着写有“我们人民不侍奉任何国王”（We The People Serve No King）标语表达反对意见，也有人特地从别州来看阅兵。
71岁的迈克路易斯带上10岁儿子到场观看。过去曾在陆军服役4年的他在受访时说：“维持一支军队需要大量经费，250周年是特别的一年，我没有意见”，他唯一担心的是，战车行经马路恐造成路面损坏而需要花大钱修复。
身穿美国国旗图样洋装的丽莎格雷说，特地开车3小时到华府观看阅兵，“很开心看到陆军历史及美国的历史”，并认为，250周年是“重大时刻，不论花费多少，我们都应该要庆祝”，许多美国军人牺牲生命，“向他们致敬是很棒的事！”
另一名民众爱德华约翰逊说，和妻子特地从奥克拉荷马到华府看阅兵日。来自军人家庭、过去曾在美国陆军服役的他还特别穿着20年前服役的军服现身。
他认为，这次阅兵花费不高，为了表扬美国军人的服务跟牺牲，“向你的国家致敬，这是很好的投资。”
他表示，美国民众有抗议的权利，不论他们的信念为何。美国最棒的事情之一就是言论权受到保护，只要是和平示威抗议，没有诉诸暴力。

抗议活动组织者预计全美50州都会举行集会，并表示数百场活动已有数百万人参与，这是自特朗普1月重返白宫以来规模最大的一次游行，目的是“拒绝威权主义、亿万富翁至上政治以及民主的军事化”。

美国各地州长都敦促民众保持冷静，并誓言绝不容忍暴力，一些州长甚至在游行人潮聚集前动员了国民警卫队。
尽管冲突是孤立事件，但在洛杉矶，警方在活动结束后使用了催泪弹和人群控制弹药驱散抗议者。一周前，洛杉矶爆发了针对联邦政府的抗议活动，并引发了全国各地的示威活动。波特兰警方还发射了催泪弹和投掷物，驱散了在美国移民和海关执法局（ICE）大楼前抗议直至深夜的人群。
抗议者举着“拒绝三K党”和“小丑不戴王冠”等标语，与周六在华盛顿举行的大规模阅兵式形成了鲜明对比。
在纽约、丹佛、芝加哥、奥斯汀和洛杉矶，抗议人潮汹涌，人群摩肩接踵，游行、载歌载舞、击鼓高呼，一些人甚至举着“不要国王”的横幅；亚特兰大5000人的抗议活动很快就达到了人数上限，数千人聚集在围栏外，聆听州议会大厦前的演讲；据《西雅图时报》报道，当地官员估计，超过7万人参加了该市市中心规模最大的集会。
约200名抗议者聚集在华盛顿西北部的洛根环岛，高呼“特朗普必须下台”，随后爆发出欢呼声。一个栩栩如生、戴着王冠、坐在金色马桶上的特朗普卡通人偶被推着穿过人群。
“不要国王联盟”在周六下午多项活动结束后发表声明称：“今天，无论红州还是蓝州，无论乡村还是大城市，美国人民和平团结，明确表明：我们不要国王。”
洛杉矶联邦大楼前的一块标语牌上写道：“唐纳德（特朗普），去接受心理治疗吧。威权主义不是自我关怀。”该大楼因特朗普下令打击移民而引发了一周多的抗议活动。
另一个标语牌上写道：“特朗普有入案照，我父亲没有，”这指的是特朗普2023年在佐治亚州被捕时留下的一张世界上最著名的嫌犯大头照之一。
在纽约，一名抗议者举着标语，上面引用了特朗普在竞选辩论中臭名昭著的指控——“移民正在吞食人们的宠物”。
标语牌写道：“他们正在吃支票。他们正在吃余额。”
在丹佛，一块牌子上写着：“选个小丑，等着看马戏表演” ；在洛杉矶，其他人也沿用了同样的主题：“小丑戴不上王冠。”
在这个LGBTQ群体活跃的城市，有关这个少数群体的标语随处可见。
一块牌子上写道：“要女王！不要国王。”
其他口号则与这个庞大的大都市息息相关。

一名身穿洛杉矶湖人队球衣的男子举着一块标语牌写道：“在洛杉矶，只有科比才是王者。”他以此纪念2020年在一次直升机坠毁事故中丧生的NBA传奇科比·布莱恩特。
有人写道：“我唯一想要的ICE（冰块）就在我的抹茶里”和“ICE在加州融化了”，矛头直指移民和海关执法局（ICE）官员，正是他们突袭工作场所和农场引发了众怒。
一些标语牌提到了他们所谓的美国正在蔓延的“法西斯主义”，其中至少有一张特朗普的照片被涂成了胡子，让他看起来像纳粹魔头希特勒。
全国各地都在谈论美国作为共和国诞生的历程，这个共和国在近250年前摆脱了英国君主制的绝对权力。
但示威者表示，他们推翻一位“国王”，并非为了用另一位国王取而代之。
一块标语牌上写道：“决不许伪国王。”
在阿拉斯加州人口不足4000的小城诺姆，这里的小型示威活动是全国数千场示威活动之一。
据当地报纸《诺姆金块报》网站发布的照片，一名示威者的标语牌上写道：“阿拉斯加人唯一想要的国王就是帝王鲑。”
一些示威者选择了简洁的表达。
一块标语牌上写道：“够了！”
还有一块标语牌上写道：“我通常不喜欢标语，但是天哪……”

Today’s march in LA had been largely peaceful before police unexpectedly began moving people away from the area. (AP pic)
LOS ANGELES
:
For hours, thousands of people in Los Angeles peacefully celebrated their defiance of US President Donald Trump today with music, marching, bubbles and balloons – then police unexpectedly moved in, and chaos and confusion broke out.
The demonstration – part of the nationwide “No Kings” day of protests across the country – was by far the largest in more than a week of protests ignited by anger against immigration raids the Trump administration has been carrying out across the country’s second-largest city.
Like those before it, today’s had been largely peaceful.
A march that began in the morning had finished, with demonstrators milling about on a sunny afternoon as the scene took on the air of a street festival.
Then police unexpectedly began moving people away from the area, igniting confusion and anger among demonstrators caught off guard and unsure of where to go.
Police on horseback pushed crowds back as law enforcement fired tear gas and flash-bang grenades hours ahead of an 8pm curfew.
A police spokesman later told local TV channel KTLA that a “small group of agitators” had begun throwing rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers, prompting the decision to order the crowd to disperse.
If people refused to leave, “we will make arrests”, she said, adding: “We have been patient all day.”
The clashes came after more than a week of demonstrations in Los Angeles against the immigration raids, which have rocked the city.
The protests have mostly been calm and contained to a small segment of downtown.
But at times they have spiralled into violence, which Trump pounced on to send in 4,000 national guard and 700 marines – an exceedingly rare deployment of soldiers on US soil against the will of local officials, who have repeatedly said the situation was under control.
The troops did not immediately appear to be involved in the clashes this afternoon, with Los Angeles police and the sheriff’s department taking the lead.
‘No faux-king Trump’
The day had begun with indigenous dancing at city hall, as musicians played a light-hearted drumbeat on metal security barriers and street vendors filled the air with the smell of frying onions.
Then, beneath a giant balloon depicting Trump as a baby wearing a diaper, the demonstrators marched through downtown Los Angeles.
Parents brought their children, pet owners their dogs, and the lunchtime crowd at one popular market along the route enjoyed tacos and donuts as demonstrators passed by chanting while passing cars honked their support.
“No faux-king Trump,” read one sign as marchers chanted “Impeach Trump!”
Passing several armed national guard in front of one federal building along the route, the protesters cried “Shame!”
Many of the signs had a light touch – “America, you in danger girl” read one, while another riffed on the acronym for immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) and a favourite drink in Los Angeles: “ICE belongs in my matcha, not the streets.”
Others were more pointed.
Many involved the words “Trump” and various expletives.
Some showed images of the president as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
“Santa Monica Fascist,” read one sign with a photo of Trump’s top immigration adviser Stephen Miller, who is from the coastal city west of downtown Los Angeles.
People waved flags – predominantly US flags, some upside down as a signal of distress; but also the flags of Mexico, El Salvador, South Korea, Palestine, California’s state flag, and the Pride flag celebrating LGBTQ rights.
“This isn’t a war zone,” protester Jennifer Franks, who was carrying her infant son, told AFP in front of city hall earlier in the day.
“There is no reason to have the military called in here… I want my child to grow up in a nation where common sense pervades.”

WASHINGTON
:
President Donald Trump hosted the largest US military parade in decades, as protesters rallied across the country to accuse him of acting like a dictator.
Trump hailed the US as the “hottest country in the world” after watching tanks, aircraft and troops file past him in Washington to honour the 250th anniversary of the US army.
But it formed a stark split screen with turmoil at home and abroad, as police used teargas to disperse protesters in Los Angeles and US ally Israel traded missile fire with Iran in a rapidly escalating conflict in the Middle East.
Trump’s parade on an overcast night in Washington came after hundreds of thousands of “No Kings” demonstrators thronged the streets in cities including New York, Philadelphia, Houston and Atlanta.
Trump largely avoided his usual domestic political diatribes in an unusually brief speech, and instead focused on praising the US army, saying that they “fight, fight, fight, and they win, win, win”.
The display of military might comes as Trump asserts his power domestically and on the international stage.
In his address to the parade, Trump sent a warning to Washington’s adversaries of “total and complete” defeat, with the US increasingly at risk of getting tangled up in Israel’s conflict with Iran.
“Time and again, America’s enemies have learned that if you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you,” Trump said.
‘Happy Birthday’

Trump had openly dreamed since his first term as president of having a grand military parade, of the type more often seen in Moscow or Pyongyang than Washington.
The last such parade in the US was at the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
When it came, Trump stood and saluted on a stage outside the White House as tanks rumbled past, aircraft roared overhead and nearly 7,000 troops marched past.
Troops and military hardware from different eras of US history passed by, with an announcer reeling off victories in battles with Japanese, German, Chinese and Vietnamese forces in past wars.
The army said the parade cost up to US$45 million.
But while the crowd sang “Happy Birthday” and there were occasional chants of “USA! USA!”, the atmosphere was less intense than one of the barnstorming rallies that swept Trump to power.
The White House said that “over 250,000 patriots showed up” for the event, without providing evidence.
Communications director Steven Cheung described the “No Kings” protests as a “complete and utter failure”.
“No Kings” organisers said protesters gathered in hundreds of cities, with AFP journalists seeing large crowds in several cities.
Organisers said they were protesting against Trump’s dictatorial overreach, and in particular what they described as the strongman symbolism of the parade.
“I think people are mad as hell,” Lindsay Ross, a 28-year-old musician, told AFP in New York, where tens of thousands of people rallied.
Some protesters targeted Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida – while a small group even gathered in Paris.
“I think it’s disgusting,” protester Sarah Hargrave, 42, said in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, describing Trump’s parade as a “display of authoritarianism”.
‘Display of authoritarianism’
Thousands turned out in Los Angeles to protest Trump’s deployment of troops in the country’s second-largest city following clashes sparked by immigration raids.
After a day of largely peaceful protests, police unexpectedly began moving people away from the protest area, igniting confusion and anger among demonstrators caught off guard and unsure of where to go.
Police on horseback pushed crowds back as law enforcement fired tear gas and flash-bang grenades hours ahead of an 8pm curfew.
A police spokesman said a “small group of agitators” had begun throwing rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers, prompting the decision to order the crowd to disperse.
If people refused to leave, “we will make arrests”, she said, adding: “We have been patient all day.”
Violence shattered the calm elsewhere, too, with a shooting at a demonstration in the western US city of Salt Lake City leaving at least one person critically injured, according to police.
The killing of a Democratic lawmaker and her husband yesterday in the northern state of Minnesota – in what the governor called a targeted attack – also cast a pall over the parade.
Trump was quick to condemn the attacks outside Minneapolis in which former state speaker Melissa Hortman was killed along with her husband, while another state lawmaker and his wife were hospitalised with gunshot wounds.

WASHINGTON (AFP): Parachutists glided through the air as soldiers marched and tanks groaned through the barricaded streets of Washington on Saturday (June 14) during a military parade long-coveted by US President Donald Trump, as a largely quiet crowd watched on.
  On the National Mall, enclosed within almost 32km of high-security fencing, nearly 7,000 soldiers and about 150 military vehicles paraded to intermittent cheers.
  Rain had threatened to wash out the event but it never came, much to the relief of those lining the four-lane street that runs past the White House, where Trump stood watching and frequently saluting the passing troops.
  The crowd was mostly quiet as soldiers in uniforms dating back to the 1700s marched past, bar the occasional shouts of "Thank you, Army!" that spurred cheers and whoops.
  Many wore Trump's signature red "Make America Great Again" baseball caps, but others attending made clear they supported the Army – but opposed the norm-bending president.
  "Personally, I'm not a fan of Trump, but I'm a fan of the Army," said Andrew Smith, 24, whose brother serves in the military.
  "I feel like we can separate politics and what we stand for, and then hopefully get along," he added.
  Beat Fascism!
  Marty Wrin echoed the sentiments expressed among the crowds of protesters gathered outside the parade area in Washington, and around the country Saturday.
  "I'm proud to be American," insisted the 56-year-old IT worker from Washington, wearing a hat saying "resist" and holding a sign saying "Go Army. Beat Fascism!"
  "I'm proud of our democracy, and I'm worried about our democracy right now for the first time in my life," he told AFP.
  Wrin said he was impressed by the parade, but did not like something he associated with dictatorships happening on US streets.
  "It's the Army being used by Trump to make himself feel more powerful," he said.
  With cloudy skies overhead, people stood on tiptoes to catch a glimpse of the military gear on display.
  Several children sat on their parents' shoulders to get a better view and waved back to soldiers sitting atop tanks and other armoured vehicles.
  Michele Sabat, who said she had attended several past Trump rallies, told AFP she was thrilled that she had travelled from Pennsylvania to watch the parade.
  "I wanted to honour the military, I feel it's the right thing to do. They protect us, they save us, and you've got to respect them," the retired 68-year-old said.
  She sat on a curb next to Camila Rodriguez, 30, watching as thousands of troops marched by in the largest such parade in decades.
  Rodriguez, an auditor from Boston, said she was impressed by what she saw.
  "All the troops... There's so many of them. So anything to support them," she said.
  "I will always be here for that." – AFP

WASHINGTON, June 15 — US President Donald Trump revelled in a long dreamt-of military parade on his 79th birthday yesterday, as demonstrators across the country branded him a dictator in the biggest protests since his return to power.
Trump stood and saluted as tanks rumbled past, aircraft roared overhead and nearly 7,000 troops marched through Washington in the largest such parade in the United States in decades.

Chants of “USA! USA!” erupted as the Republican took to a giant stage in front of the White House for the parade which officially marked the 250th birthday of the US Army, but also happened to fall on Trump’s own.
The deep political divisions in the United States were underscored however as “No Kings” demonstrators thronged the streets in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Washington, Houston and Atlanta.

“I think people are mad as hell,” Lindsay Ross, a 28-year-old musician, told AFP in New York, where tens of thousands of people rallied.

The killing of a Democratic lawmaker and her husband yesterday in the northern state of Minnesota — in what authorities called a targeted attack — also cast a pall over the parade.
Trump was quick to condemn the attacks outside Minneapolis in which former state speaker Melissa Hortman died along with her husband, while another state lawmaker and his wife were hospitalised with gunshot wounds.

‘Big day’ 
Military parades are a more common sight in capitals like Moscow and Pyongyang than Washington, but Trump has openly expressed his wishes for one since his first term.
His dream came true yesterday with a US$45-million (RM191-million) spectacle — although starting around half an hour early because of the threat of thunderstorms raining on his parade.
The procession began with a 21-gun salute followed by the presentation of a flag to Trump by the army’s Golden Knights parachute team who dropped from the sky.
Two huge Abrams tanks were stationed in front of the stage where Trump sat.

Troops and military hardware from different eras of US history then passed by, with an announcer reeling off victories over Japanese, German, Chinese and Vietnamese forces in past wars.
Trump, who saluted a number of times and chatted occasionally to First Lady Melania Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth during the parade, was due to give remarks later.
The Republican, who has begun his second term by pushing presidential powers to unprecedented levels, boasted earlier on his Truth Social network that it was a “big day for America!!!”
He added that Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, for whom he has repeatedly expressed admiration, had “very nicely” called him to wish him a happy birthday.
The two leaders also agreed on the need for an end to the Iran-Israel conflict — a war in which US forces are aiding Israel to shoot down Tehran’s missiles.

‘Vulgar display’ 
The White House meanwhile dismissed the “No Kings” rallies as a “complete and utter failure” and said the numbers involved were “miniscule,” despite images of streets filled with protesters.
Organisers expected protests in all 50 states against what they call Trump’s dictatorial overreach, and in particular what they described as the strongman symbolism of the parade.
Thousands turned out in Los Angeles to protest Trump’s deployment of troops in the country’s second-largest city following clashes sparked by immigration raids.

“I think it’s disgusting,” protester Sarah Hargrave, 42, told AFP in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, describing Trump’s parade as a “display of authoritarianism.”
Critics have accused Trump of acting like the United States’s autocratic adversaries.

（华盛顿15日综合电）美国总统特朗普长久以来梦寐以够的军事阅兵于当地时间周六傍晚（马来西亚时间 星期日上午）在华盛顿市中心隆重登场，庆祝美国陆军建军250周年。不过，这场庆典却笼灵罩在暴力与社会分裂的阴影下！
路透社报道，在阅兵开始的数小时前，数十万美国民众已涌上纽约、芝加哥、洛杉矶街头，抗议特朗普的施政。当天稍早，明尼苏达两名民主党议员遭到枪手暗杀，酿成一死一伤悲剧，嫌凶仍在逃。

另外，以色列周六也对伊朗发动第二波空袭，试图摧毁核计划设施。前一天，伊朗的反击行动，已让两国之间的冲突风险急剧升高，引发国际关切。在这一连串事件之前是洛杉矶为期一周的紧张局势。联邦移民当局的突袭行动引发抗议，特朗普动用国民兵和陆战队进驻。 美国总统特朗普和第一夫人梅兰妮出席阅兵式。（美联社照片） 
尽管如此，特朗普的阅兵仍在星期日庆祝79岁生日当天举行，因华府天气预报将有雷阵雨，时间比原定提前。

数以千计观众聚集在靠近国家广场的宪法大道沿线，阅兵以铜管乐队揭开序幕。特朗普坐在高台上检阅队伍，出场时受到支持者欢呼。特朗普一直渴望在美国举行类似其他国家的军事阅兵，这在美国历史上极为罕见。上次大规模阅兵是在1991年，庆祝在波斯湾战争中将伊拉克总统沙旦胡先的军队赶出科威特。

  
这次阅兵出动近7000名士兵、150辆军车，包括25辆M1艾布兰（M1 Abrams）坦克、28辆斯特莱克（Stryker）装甲车、4辆圣骑士（Paladin）自走炮和多种榴弹炮例如M777和M119。美国官员透露，阅兵与相关开支，包含装备运输、士兵食宿总计2500万美元（1.05亿令吉）至4500万美元（1.9亿令吉）之间。


批评人士认为，这场阅兵是炫耀武力的“威权表演”，与特朗普所提倡的政府开支紧缩政策自相矛盾。支持特朗为的民众亨利从得州飞来华府参加活动，对于战车上街毫不反感。61岁的他说：“我不觉得这有什么争议，与其混乱无序，我更愿意选择安全与稳定。”

然而，之前，大批民众涌上华府与全美其他城市街头抗议特朗普政策，抗议大致上和平进行，是特朗普今年初重返白宫以来最大规模的反对声浪。美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）报道，预料全美各地将有数百万人上街抗议特朗普。反特朗普团体策划将近2000场同步示威，主题是“不要国王”（No Kings），强调无人能凌驾法律之上。

原定在明尼苏达举行的“不要国王”抗议行动全数取消，民主党州长沃尔兹表示，民主党议员默丽莎霍特曼因政治动机遭到暗杀，另一名议员约翰霍夫曼也受伤。

在洛杉矶大批示威民众聚集在市中心罗伊博联邦大楼前，与部署的陆战队对峙。这里日前爆发抗争者与警察的冲突。群众与陆战队仅相隔3公尺，他们大声齐喊：“可耻！可耻！”、“陆战队滚出洛杉矶！”
参加“拒绝法西斯”（RefuseFascism.org）组织的400名示威者在华府游行，并在白宫对面公园集会。特朗普事先警告不要在阅兵现场示威，否则“将遭遇强力反制。”
“拒绝法西斯”创办人桑沙拉泰勒在集会上对群众说：“我们今天拒绝接受特朗普将军队用来对付人民、出现在街头。我们说，绝不接受！”

LOS ANGELES, June 15 — For hours, thousands of people in Los Angeles peacefully celebrated their defiance of US President Donald Trump Saturday with music, marching, bubbles and balloons — then police unexpectedly moved in, and chaos and confusion broke out.
The demonstration — part of the nationwide “No Kings” day of protests across the country — was by far the largest in more than a week of protests ignited by anger against immigration raids the Trump administration has been carrying out across the country’s second-largest city.

Like those before it, yesterday’s had been largely peaceful. A march that began in the morning had finished, with demonstrators milling about on a sunny afternoon as the scene took on the air of a street festival.
Then police unexpectedly began moving people away from the area, igniting confusion and anger among demonstrators caught off guard and unsure of where to go.

Police on horseback pushed crowds back as law enforcement fired tear gas and flash-bang grenades hours ahead of an 8pm (0300 GMT/11am Malaysian time) curfew.
A police spokeswoman later told local TV channel KTLA that a “small group of agitators” had begun throwing rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers, prompting the decision to order the crowd to disperse.


If people refused to leave, “we will make arrests,” she said, adding: “We have been patient all day.”
The clashes came after more than a week of demonstrations in Los Angeles against the immigration raids, which have rocked the city.
The protests have mostly been calm and contained to a small segment of downtown.
But at times they have spiralled into violence, which Trump pounced on to send in 4,000 National Guard and 700 Marines — an exceedingly rare deployment of soldiers on US soil against the will of local officials, who have repeatedly said the situation was under control.
The troops did not immediately appear to be involved in the clashes yesterday afternoon, with Los Angeles police and the sheriff’s department taking the lead.

‘No faux-king Trump’ 
The day had begun with Indigenous dancing at City Hall, as musicians played a light-hearted drumbeat on metal security barriers and street vendors filled the air with the smell of frying onions.
Then, beneath a giant balloon depicting Trump as a baby wearing a diaper, the demonstrators marched through downtown Los Angeles.
Parents brought their children, pet owners their dogs, and the lunchtime crowd at one popular market along the route enjoyed tacos and donuts as demonstrators passed by chanting while passing cars honked their support.
“No faux-king Trump,” read one sign as marchers chanted “Impeach Trump!”
Passing several armed National Guard in front of one federal building along the route, the protesters cried “Shame!”
Many of the signs had a light touch — “America, you in danger girl” read one, while another riffed on the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a favourite drink in Los Angeles: “ICE belongs in my matcha, not the streets.”
Others were more pointed.
Many involved the words “Trump” and various expletives. Some showed images of the president as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
“Santa Monica Fascist,” read one sign with a photo of Trump’s top immigration adviser Stephen Miller, who is from the coastal city west of downtown Los Angeles.
People waved flags — predominantly US flags, some upside down as a signal of distress; but also the flags of Mexico, El Salvador, South Korea, the Palestinians, California’s state flag, and the Pride flag celebrating LGBTQ rights.
“This isn’t a war zone,” protester Jennifer Franks, who was carrying her infant son, told AFP in front of City Hall earlier in the day.
“There is no reason to have the military called in here... I want my child to grow up in a nation where common sense pervades.” — AFP

 Sunday, 15 Jun 2025 10:01 AM MYT 


NEW YORK, June 15 — A giant orange balloon depicting President Donald Trump in a diaper towered over one “No Kings” protest today, as tens of thousands thronged streets across the United States to decry the president’s policies.
Protest organisers expected rallies in all 50 US states, calling them the largest since Trump returned to office in January, with the aim of “rejecting authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarisation of our democracy.”

Wielding signs with messages like “No KKKings!”, “No crown for the clown” and “The Trump fascist regime must go now!” the protests stood in stark contrast to the massive military parade planned in Washington later Saturday.
That parade is meant to commemorate the founding of the US Army, but also falls on the president’s 79th birthday.

“I am here today to tell the world that we don’t have kings in America. In America, the law is king,” Ilene Ryan told AFP at a demonstration in Boston.

In New York, tens of thousands of people, wearing raincoats and carrying colourful umbrellas, marched down Fifth Avenue in the downpour to the sound of drums, bells and crowd chants of “Hey, hey, oh, oh, Donald Trump has got to go!”
Actors Susan Sarandon and Mark Ruffalo were seen getting drenched among the protesters.

‘Outraged’ 
A few blocks away, Polly Shulman was preparing to join the march with her “Protect the Constitution” sign.
“I’m miserable and outraged about how this administration is destroying the ideals of the American Constitution,” the 62-year-old museum employee told AFP.
The most shocking thing, she said, was “the illegal deportations of law-abiding residents.”
They are “being kidnapped and disappeared and sent to torture prisons in foreign countries.”
In March, the Trump administration expelled more than 250 Venezuelans to a mega-prison in El Salvador after accusing them of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang, which it has declared a terrorist organisation.
At least four protesters were arrested at a separate, smaller protest against Trump’s immigration crackdown at New York’s Federal Plaza Saturday, police said.

‘Mad as hell’ 
“I think people are mad as hell,” Lindsay Ross, a 28-year-old musician, told AFP, urging the masses to show “the administration that we’re not going to take this.”
Bill Kennedy, a retired psychologist from Pennsylvania, was in Washington protesting a few hours before Trump’s big parade there.
“I’m tired of the current administration. I think they’re a bunch of fascists,” he said, describing the Trump parade as “ridiculous.”
Suzanne Brown in Boston also lamented the money spent on the parade “for one man’s vanity.”
Massive “No Kings” protests were also underway in Los Angeles, which in recent days has been rocked by demonstrations over the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, as federal agents carried out brutal arrests of even law-abiding people without papers.
Yesterday, protesters gathered in front of federal buildings shouting “You are not welcome here” at some of the 4,000 National Guard members and 700 US Marines that Trump dispatched to the city against the wishes of city and state authorities.
With a giant orange Trump-in-a-diaper balloon towering above them, thousands filled the city streets, sporting slogans like “No faux-king way” and “Impeach Trump”.
Members of Russian feminist protest and performance art group Pussy Riot held up a large red banner in front of LA city hall warning: “It’s beginning to look a lot like Russia.”
Iris Rodriguez, 44, explained that her family arrived in the United States without papers.
“I find it really, really personal... If this was my mom, if this were the 80s, this would be happening to her,” she told AFP.
“I was a little scared, but I refuse to be too scared to not come.”
The country-wide demonstrations overwhelmingly took place peacefully and without incident.
But in Culpeper, Virginia, police said a man had “intentionally” rammed his car into a group of protesters as they left the event.
The man, identified as 21-year-old Joseph R. Checklick Jr., “intentionally accelerated his vehicle into the dispersing crowd, striking at least one person with his vehicle,” police said, adding that he had been arrested and no injuries had so far been reported. — AFP

PRIME minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has bombed Iran in what may lead to yet another war in the Middle East, and the challenge for President Donald Trump will be not only to protect American troops in the region, but also to stay out of this mess.
Netanyahu justified his latest military campaign by saying that Iran was a “clear and present danger.” And it’s true that Iran was enriching uranium to worrisome levels. It’s believed to be just weeks from having enough fissile material to make several bombs (although creating bombs and a way to deliver them would take much longer).

Tony Fonseka formed the Merdeka Choir with broadcasting and music icon Ahmad Merican and served as its conductor. (Fonseka family pic)
PETALING JAYA
:
For many, “Negaraku” evokes memories of school assemblies and the singing of the national anthem. But for Alfred Fonseka, it carries a deeper, more personal significance.
That’s because his late father, Tony, formed the Merdeka Choir with renowned broadcasting and music icon
Ahmad Merican
. Tony also served as the choir’s conductor and led the group to perform “Negaraku” during the country’s independence celebrations in 1957.
Tony, whose full name was Andrew Anthony Fonseka, passed away from a heart attack in 1965, less than a decade after the Merdeka Choir’s debut. He was 59.
This Father’s Day, Alfred – the youngest of Tony’s 10 children – reflects on cherished memories of his dad and the legacy he left behind.
“My mum would tag along for choir rehearsals and I’d follow them. I used to enjoy watching my father conducting the choir – everybody listened to him,” Alfred told FMT Lifestyle.
“I remember thinking, ‘He must be someone important, right?’ And he taught most of them to read music.”

Alfred recalled how his parents, seated under the glow of an oil lamp in their wooden house in Kampung Kerinchi, Kuala Lumpur, would carefully count the money the choir had earned from performances, making sure it was divided equally among all the members.
His father, he added, always ensured everyone got a rounded amount – even topping up from his own pocket when necessary.
“For example, if everyone was supposed to get RM1.80, he’d add 20 sen so they’d each get RM2,” explained Alfred, 76.
He described his father as a “very strict” man – although, as the youngest child, Alfred enjoyed more freedom than his older siblings!
Despite his father’s stern demeanour, Alfred understood that Tony’s discipline came from a place of love. “I knew he worried about me when I wasn’t home on time,” he said.

Alfred still remembers accompanying his father to music classes he’d taught, riding behind Tony on his Lambretta scooter.
Another cherished memory is of Tony teaching him the guitar chords for “All My Loving” by The Beatles, when Alfred was preparing for a talentime competition in secondary school.
Tony also spent countless hours at the piano, composing music. Among his well-known works is the patriotic song “Benderaku”. Click

to have a listen – you might find it surprisingly familiar!

Alfred also recalled a story his mother once told him. “My father’s life was literally saved by music. During the Japanese occupation, he was charged with being a British collaborator. The sword was already at his neck, and he was about to be beheaded.”
At the last moment, a Japanese officer intervened: he had recognised Tony from a function during which Tony had played a tune the officer hummed.
That day, Tony’s life was spared.

Alfred had only been in Form Five when his father passed away. “His passing left a void – something had been taken from us, just like that. When I went to bed, he wasn’t there. When I woke up in the morning, he wasn’t there. When I came back from school, he wasn’t there.”
After his passing, the publication Radio Weekly wrote that “children all over Malaysia have lost a ‘father’ in the passing away of the grand old man of children’s songs”.
Tony had joined Radio Malaysia in 1963, where he primarily produced “children’s musical programmes and children’s choirs”, in addition to composing patriotic songs.
Alfred shared that Tony had deeply loved his country. He recalled how his brother, Robert, and their father would go into the Radio Malaysia studio to record the national anthem, as Tony had wanted Malaysians to sing it correctly.
While he is proud of Tony’s legacy, Alfred feels sad that his father hasn’t been properly recognised. (Muhammad Rabbani Jamian @ FMT Lifestyle)
After his father passed away, the Merdeka Choir gradually faded. Reflecting on his father’s legacy, Alfred expressed both pride and sadness as he feels Tony hasn’t been properly recognised.
Asked what he wants the younger generation to know about his dad, he said: “Occasionally, young people would ask me, ‘Are you related to the music guy?’ I’d reply, ‘Which music guy?’
‘And when they’d say, ‘The one from the Merdeka Choir’, I’d say, ‘Yeah, that’s my father.’ He was the man who taught the country to sing the national anthem.”
Tony and Ahmad’s journey to form the Merdeka Choir was captured in the 2019 short film ‘Getaran Pertama’, which you can view

AHMEDABAD: Grieving families were due to hold funerals in India on Sunday (June 15) for their relatives who were among at least 279 killed in one of the world's worst plane crashes in decades.
  Health officials have begun handing over the first passenger bodies identified through DNA testing, delivering them in white coffins in the western city of Ahmedabad.
  "My heart is very heavy, how do we give the bodies to the families?" said Tushar Leuva, an NGO worker who has been helping with the recovery efforts.
  There was just one survivor out of 242 passengers and crew on board the Air India jet when it crashed Thursday into a residential area of Ahmedabad, killing at least 38 people on the ground.
  "How will they react when they open the gate? But we'll have to do it," Leuva told AFP at the mortuary on Saturday.
  One victim's relative who did not want to be named told AFP they had been instructed not to open the coffin when they receive it.
  Witnesses reported seeing badly burnt bodies and scattered remains.
  The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner erupted into a fireball when it went down moments after takeoff, smashing into buildings used by medical staff.
  Mourning relatives have been providing DNA samples to be matched with passengers, with 31 identified as of Sunday morning.
  "This is a meticulous and slow process, so it has to be done meticulously only," Rajnish Patel, a doctor at Ahmedabad's civil hospital, said late Saturday.
  The majority of those injured on the ground have been discharged, he added, with one or two remaining in critical care.
  Indian authorities are yet to detail the cause of the disaster and have ordered inspections of Air India's Dreamliners.
  Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu said Saturday he hoped decoding the recovered black box, or flight data recorder, would "give an in-depth insight" into what went wrong.
  Just one person miraculously escaped the wreckage, British citizen Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, whose brother was also on the flight.
  Air India said there were 169 Indian passengers, 53 British, seven Portuguese and a Canadian on board the flight, as well as 12 crew members.
  While communities were in mourning, one woman recounted how she survived only by arriving late at the airport.
  "The airline staff had already closed the check-in," said 28-year-old Bhoomi Chauhan.
  "At that moment, I kept thinking that if only we had left a little earlier, we wouldn't have missed our flight," she told the Press Trust of India news agency. - AFP

网路上流行的“禁欲挑战”，可能会给男性带来“反效果”。（示意图）
（台北15日讯）
禁欲
100天等于变强壮？还是出大事？泌尿科医生提醒，禁欲可能带来的4大影响，包括
勃起
困难、变成快枪侠、
精子
品质下滑、情绪不稳。
台湾泌尿科医生白彝维在Instagram发帖说，网路上流行的“禁欲挑战”，有人说越忍越强，也有人说会变快枪侠，到底真相是什么？其实“弟弟”太久没开机，真的有可能出事。

白彝维分享，禁欲可能带来的4大影响：
1、性敏感度下降，勃起变得困难
对某些人而言，长期缺乏性刺激可能会让性反应变得较迟钝，尤其是已经有性功能障碍倾向者。
2、变成“快枪侠”
部分男性可能出现这样的情况，太久没亲密接触，一有机会就过于兴奋，反而更容易早泄！
3、精子品质下滑
精子如果长时间没释放，过度延迟排精，可能会影响部分男性的精液品质，活动力下降。
4、情绪不稳，影响工作生活
部分人长期压抑性欲，性冲动无处释放，可能导致烦躁易怒、注意力不集中，生活品质也跟著下降。
白彝维提醒，长期禁欲可能增加摄护腺发炎风险，定期射精有助于“让摄护腺运动一下”；也有研究显示，定期射精可能有助降低摄护腺发炎与癌症风险。他认为，禁欲不是万灵丹，关键在找到对的方法。

A typhoon changed its path and landed in southern China’s Hainan island.
  Typhoon Wutip, landed in Basuo township at a severe tropical storm level in the city of Dongfang in Hainan province, according to Hainan Meteo­rological Service.
  Its maximum sustained winds is 30m per second.
  This is the second time in 70 years the island has the country’s first typhoon in the year.
  Typhoon Wutip was forecasted to make landfall around noon yesterday on the Chinese mainland near the border between Guangdong province and the Guangxi region.
  Authorities in Guangdong pro­vince evacuated more than 10,000 people, closed schools and cancelled flights, trains and vessels on Friday.
  It is unclear if Typhoon Wutip has caused any deaths or injuries.
  Photos posted by a Chinese news outlet showed toppled trees and a strewn corrugated metal fence at a construction site in the city of Sanya, a popular beach resort on Hainan.
  All schools, construction sites and tourist attractions in Sanya were closed and flights were suspended at the city’s airport, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
  A dozen crew members were rescued on Thursday night from a cargo ship that called for help, Xinhua said.
  The crew were transferred to a rescue vessel in rough seas with 3m waves.
  Typhoon Wutip had maximum sustained winds of 119kph before it landed.
  Guangdong activated rescue boats and helicopters, and more than 49,000 fishing boats returned to port, Xinhua said.
  The provincial meteorological agency forecast heavy rain and said tornadoes were possible.
  Wutip means “butterfly” in Cantonese. Countries and the Chinese regions of Hong Kong and Macau contribute the names for storms during the typhoon season.
  The last time the island had the country’s first typhoon landfall was in 2008 with Typhoon Neoguri. Neoguri means “raccoon” in Korean. — AP

HANOI, June 15 — Typhoon winds and rains that lashed central Vietnam killed five people and left two more missing, according to an official toll, with huge tracts of farmland flooded by the deluge.
  Typhoon Wutip made landfall in southern China yesterday with winds gusting up to 128 kilometres per hour and was downgraded to a tropical storm after swooping up the Gulf of Tonkin on Vietnam’s flank.
  Vietnam’s agriculture ministry said yesterday evening that three people had been killed in central Quang Tri province, with two more fatalities and two people missing in Quang Binh province.
  More than 70,000 hectares of cropland were flooded, the ministry said.
  Chinese authorities on the southern island of Hainan evacuated thousands of people, closed schools and halted rail services on Friday ahead of the storm’s landfall.
  However, the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre forecast yesterday that the storm would “weaken to dissipation” by the end of the weekend.
  Natural disasters are becoming more severe and more frequent as a result of climate change. They claimed 514 lives in Vietnam last year, three times more than in 2023, according to the agriculture ministry.
  In September, northern Vietnam was devastated by Typhoon Yagi, which killed 345 people and caused an estimated economic loss of US$3.3 billion (RM14 billion). — AFP

The country will no longer send a delegation to the United States for tariff negotiations as its proposal to Washington has already been deemed sufficient, according to the senior minister who’s leading the talks.
  It’s a change from the delegation’s previous plans to head to Washington this week for a se­cond round of negotiations, as the South-East Asian nation works to bring down a planned 32% tariff on its exports to the United States.
  The progress also comes just hours after Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and US President Donald Trump held a nearly 15-minute phone call to talk about strengthening ties between the two countries.
  Indonesia has submitted all necessary documents and will now just await the decision from Washington, Coordinating Eco­no­mic Minister Airlangga Hartarto said in a briefing on Friday.
  The US Trade Representative told Indonesian officials in a meeting on Thursday that their documentation was considered complete, Hartarto separately told reporters on Friday.
  It highlights the global rush to strike a deal with the United States as the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs is set to end on July 9.
  South-East Asia has been one of the hardest-hit regions, with higher-­than-expected levies seen to undermine their export and manufacturing sectors that have been crucial to driving economic growth.
  Vietnamese officials are in the United States for a third round of official negotiations, while Malay­sia’s delegation is headed for Washington next week.
  Thailand is expecting to conduct talks virtually but is waiting for an exact date.
  Likely bolstering Indonesia’s confidence in the negotiations is a call between Trump and Prabowo late Thursday.
  The leaders gave updates on recent developments in their countries and agreed to continue boosting cooperation, Indonesia’s cabinet secretariat said in an Instagram post on Friday.
  They also reaffirmed their support for efforts to maintain global stability and peace, it said. — Bloomberg

Don’t panic: Even if time is running out, states must avoid premature concessions because US trade policy remains in flux, with legal challenges ongoing. — 123rf

THE clock is ticking as a deadline nears for Indonesia to hash out a trade deal with the United States or risk punishing tariffs imposed on almost all Indo-nesian goods shipped to the world’s largest economy.
These are not your usual trade negotiations, where two or more countries come together as equals to reduce import tariffs on each other’s export goods. Instead, Washington unilaterally imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries and is now seeking concessions to lift them.

US President Donald Trump’s tariffs – especially the ultra-high “reciprocal tariffs” that he says will be reintroduced on July 8 for any country that has not struck a trade deal with his administration – have sent countries around the world scrambling to respond, adapt, and limit the fallout. Asean’s 10 members – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam – have been among the most proactive.
Their leaders quickly recognised that, after decades of spectacular gross domestic product growth, Asean is an economic force that the Trump administration would have to reckon with in a serious way. In 2000, Japan was the world’s second- largest economy, some eight times larger than Asean; today, it is only 1.1 times larger, and by 2030, Asean’s economy will overtake it. From 2010 to 2020, Asean contributed more to global economic growth than the European Union did.

BEIJING, June 15 — The renewed US-China trade truce struck in London left a key area of export restrictions tied to national security untouched, an unresolved conflict that threatens a more comprehensive deal, two people briefed on detailed outcomes of the talks told Reuters.
  Beijing has not committed to grant export clearance for some specialised rare-earth magnets that US military suppliers need for fighter jets and missile systems, the people said. The United States maintains export curbs on China’s purchases of advanced artificial intelligence chips out of concern that they also have military applications.
  At talks in London last week, China’s negotiators appeared to link progress in lifting export controls on military-use rare earth magnets with the longstanding US curbs on exports of the most advanced AI chips to China. That marked a new twist in trade talks that began with opioid trafficking, tariff rates and China’s trade surplus, but have since shifted to focus on export controls.
  In addition, US officials also signalled they are looking to extend existing tariffs on China for a further 90 days beyond the August 10 deadline agreed in Geneva last month, both sources said, suggesting a more permanent trade deal between the world’s two largest economies is unlikely before then.
  The two people who spoke to Reuters about the London talks requested not to be named because both sides have tightly controlled disclosure. The White House, State Department and Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China’s Foreign and Commerce ministries did not respond to faxed requests for comment.
  President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the handshake deal reached in London between American and Chinese negotiators was a “great deal,” adding, “we have everything we need, and we’re going to do very well with it. And hopefully they are too.”
  And US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there would be no “quid pro quo” on easing curbs on exports of AI chips to China in exchange for access to rare earths.
  China chokehold 
  But China’s chokehold on the rare earth magnets needed for weapons systems remains a potential flashpoint.
  China dominates global production of rare earths and holds a virtual monopoly on refining and processing.
  A deal reached in Geneva last month to reduce bilateral tariffs from crushing triple-digit levels had faltered over Beijing’s restrictions on critical minerals exports that took shape in April.
  That prompted the Trump administration to respond with export controls preventing shipments of semiconductor design software, jet engines for Chinese-made planes and other goods to China.
  At the London talks, China promised to fast-track approval of rare-earth export applications from non-military US manufacturers out of the tens of thousands currently pending, one of the sources said. Those licenses will have a six-month term. Beijing also offered to set up a “green channel” for expediting license approvals from trusted US companies.
  Initial signals were positive, with Chinese rare-earths magnet producer JL MAG Rare-Earth, saying on Wednesday it had obtained export licences that included the United States, while China’s Commerce Ministry confirmed it had approved some “compliant applications” for export licences.
  But China has not budged on specialised rare earths, including samarium, which are needed for military applications and are outside the fast-track agreed in London, the two people said. Automakers and other manufacturers largely need other rare earth magnets, including dysprosium and terbium.
  Big issues remain 
  The rushed trade meeting in London followed a call last week between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Trump said US tariffs would be set at 55 per cent for China, while China had agreed to 10 per cent from the United States.
  Trump initially imposed tariffs on China as punishment for its massive trade surplus to the United States and over what he says is Beijing’s failure to stem the flow of the powerful opioid fentanyl into the US
  Chinese analysts are pessimistic about the likelihood of further breakthroughs before the August 10 deadline agreed in Geneva.
  “Temporary mutual accommodation of some concerns is possible but the fundamental issue of the trade imbalance cannot be resolved within this timeframe, and possibly during Trump’s remaining term,” said Liu Weidong, a US-China expert at the Institute of American Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
  An extension of the August deadline could allow the Trump administration more time to establish an alternative legal claim for setting higher tariffs on China under the Section 301 authority of the USTR in case Trump loses the ongoing legal challenge to the tariffs in US court, one of the people with knowledge of the London talks said.
  The unresolved issues underscore the difficulty the Trump administration faces in pushing its trade agenda with China because of Beijing’s control of rare earths and its willingness to use that as leverage with Washington, said Ryan Hass, director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution.
  “It has taken the Trump team a few punches in the nose to recognise that they will no longer be able to secure another trade agreement with China that disproportionately addresses Trump’s priorities,” Hass said. — Reuters

（伦敦15日综合电）中美在伦敦的新一轮贸易谈判据报未解决用于军事方面的
稀土出口
问题，而这可能阻碍两国达成更全面的协议。
路透社星期日引述两名知情人士报道，北京尚未承诺为美国军方供应用于战斗机和导弹系统等装备的特种稀土磁体出口许可。同时，美国仍限制中国采购先进人工智能（AI）晶片，理由是这些晶片具备潜在的军用价值。
ADVERTISEMENT
知情人士还透露，美国官员正考虑将上月在日内瓦达成的关税暂停期限从8月10日再延长90天，显示两国在此之前达成全面协议的可能性不高。
白宫、国务院和商务部尚未立即回应置评请求。中国外交部和商务部也未回复传真置评请求。
中美关系
自4月2日美国掀起关税战后加剧恶化，双方在5月12日在日内瓦达成暂降关税协议，但因美国在经贸、科技、教育等方面遏制中国，北京限制稀土出口导致美企供应链出问题而闹僵。
两国上周在伦敦进行为期两天的谈判后达成框架，但双方都没有说明何谓“框架”，也没有透露框架具体内容。美国总统特朗普随后发文称，已与中国达成“协议”，中国将提前向美国供应“全部磁铁及必要稀土”，美国则将向中国提供双方已同意的，包括让中国学生使用美国大学资源。
美国财长贝森特则强调，美国不会以放宽AI晶片出口限制，换取对中国稀土的准入。
但中国对武器系统所需稀土磁体的垄断，仍然是一个潜在的导火索。
中国在全球稀土生产中占据主导地位，并在精炼和加工领域几乎垄断了市场。
上个月在日内瓦达成的一项旨在降低双边关税的协议，该协议原本预计在关税率上达到惊人的三位数，但由于北京方面于4月份对关键矿产出口实施限制，该协议未能达成。
这促使特朗普政府采取出口管制措施，禁止向中国出口半导体设计软件、中国制造飞机的喷气发动机和其他商品。
知情人士说，中方在伦敦会谈中承诺将加快审批非军用美国企业的稀土出口申请，目前这类申请累计已达数万份，相关出口许可证有效期为六个月。北京还提议为“可信”的美企设立绿色通道，以简化审批流程。
中证实已批准部分合规申请
目前，谈判取得一定初步成果。中国稀土磁体制造商金力永磁上周三宣布已获得对美国的出口许可。中国商务部也证实，已批准部分合规申请。
但知情人士指出，对于包括钐在内的部分军用特种稀土，中方依然未作让步，这类稀土也未被纳入伦敦协议所涵盖的快速审批范围。汽车制造商及其他行业主要使用的是其他类型的稀土磁体，包括镝和铽。
此次伦敦紧急贸易会谈是在特朗普与中国国家主席习近平上周通话之后举行的。特朗普披露，美国将对中国征收55%的关税，而中国已同意对美国征收10%的关税。
特朗普最初对中国征收关税，是为了惩罚中国对美国的巨额贸易顺差，以及他所说的北京未能阻止强效鸦片类药物芬太尼流入美国。
中国分析人士对在8月10日日内瓦商定的最后期限前取得进一步突破的可能性持悲观态度。
中国社会科学院美国研究所的美中问题专家刘卫东表示：“双方暂时就一些关切达成和解是可能的，但贸易不平衡的根本问题无法在这段时间内得到解决，甚至可能无法在特朗普的剩余任期内得到解决。”
一位了解伦敦谈判情况的人士表示，延长8月的最后期限可能会让特朗普政府有更多时间根据美国贸易代表办公室的301条款授权，提出对中国征收更高关税的替代法律主张，以防特朗普在美国法院输掉对关税的法律挑战。
布鲁金斯学会桑顿中国中心主任哈斯表示，这些悬而未决的问题凸显了特朗普政府在推进其对华贸易议程方面面临的困难，因为北京控制着稀土，并愿意利用这一点作为对华盛顿的筹码。
他说：“特朗普团队遭受了几次打击才意识到，他们将无法再与中国达成另一项不成比例地满足特朗普优先事项的贸易协定。”
在中美双方寻求缓解紧张局势的框架之际，中国在稀土领域的主导地位使其对美国拥有强大的贸易筹码。图为在中国南方江西省赣州市，重型设备在运载含有稀土的泥层。（美联社照片）

Chinese solar and energy-storage companies will continue to press ahead with their overseas expansion with or without a long-term agreement on trade tariffs, as production abroad holds the key to their long-term survival, according to executives at China’s largest solar industry exhibition.
  Although the US and China reached a 90-day truce in their ongoing tariff war in May, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US are still subject to tariffs of as much as 3,521 per cent, with Washington citing unfair trade practices such as subsidies and dumping for the high levies.
  “The industry used to say that you either go overseas or exit the game,” said Gao Jifan, chairman of Trina Solar, one of the world’s largest solar-panel manufacturers, at the SNEC PV+ Photovoltaic Power Conference and Exhibition in Shanghai. “Now, due to tariffs, simply exporting isn’t enough; you must also localise production abroad.”
  Chinese firms are increasingly diversifying their production base in response to the trade tensions. Currently, about 80 per cent of existing Chinese solar manufacturers’ overseas capacity – solar wafers, solar cells and modules – was in Southeast Asia, according to data from S&P Global Commodity Insights.
  However, nearly 80 per cent of their planned overseas capacity expansion was in the Middle East and Africa, followed by the US and Europe, it added.
  “There is no clear indication of whether the tariffs will increase or decrease after the 90-day pause,” said He Lipeng, vice general manager of Qingdao Haier Energy Technology, the solar and energy-storage unit of Chinese electronics giant Haier Group. “However, if tariffs were to rise to 200 per cent, [exports] would be impossible.”
  Haier Energy was considering using the US plants of its parent company, acquired from GE Appliances in 2016, to produce solar photovoltaic (PV) and energy-storage equipment, He said.
  The facilities are currently used for manufacturing consumer durables like refrigerators and washing machines for the US. He said no decision had been made on when the switch to manufacturing solar products would be made.
  The mood at the four-day event, which attracted some 3,000 companies from more than 100 countries, was sombre. Chinese solar PV companies, which dominate more than 80 per cent of global manufacturing capacity, have voiced concerns about the prolonged price war, expected to worsen this year, and challenging geopolitical conditions.
  You Xin, an analyst at S&P Global, said a sharp decline in planned capacity in Southeast Asia was due to the devastating US tariffs.
  As the US remained the most attractive market due to its high margins and size, the restrictions were forcing Chinese companies to divert capacities to other regions where the US tariffs were lower, she said.
  The Middle East and Africa were favourable destinations due to conducive government policies and huge demand, she added.
  The Middle East’s cumulative solar capacity was projected to reach 160 gigawatts (GW) by 2033, an eightfold increase from 2023, because of ambitious national targets, according to Wood Mackenzie. Similarly, Africa’s solar PV market was promising, with 140GW of new grid-connected capacity expected by 2033, with a third of these installations projected to come from Egypt and South Africa, the consultancy added.
  Jinko Solar was expanding its Middle East capacity with a 10GW solar project in Saudi Arabia, chairman Li Xiande said at a briefing hosted by the Shanghai Stock Exchange last month.
  CSI Solar, an affiliate of Nasdaq-listed Canadian Solar, was eyeing the Middle East, CEO Zhuang Yan said at the same briefing. Work was also progressing on CSI’s 5GW solar module project in the US, which was expected to reach designed capacity in the second half of this year.
  “In this industry, when we establish production capacity in various countries, it’s not meant for those local markets,” said Zhang Haimeng, vice-president and chief sustainability officer of Longi, the world’s third-largest solar-module maker.
  “Whether [the capacity is] in Southeast Asia, Saudi Arabia, Oman or Ethiopia, the goal is to sell to the US. Building capacity based on local demand doesn’t make economic sense; it’s all geared towards the US market,” he said at the Shanghai solar conference this week. - SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST

A growing wave of international condemnation has poured in over the renewed effort to name late president Suharto (pic, left ) as a national hero, with a coalition of global civic groups warning the plan could whitewash decades of human rights abuses and corruption by the former leader.
  Suharto, who was also the former father-in-law of President Prabowo Subianto, has been included on the list of nominees for this year’s national heroes that is still under the scrutiny of the Social Affairs Ministry’s Cen­tral Research and Assessment Team for Title (TP2GP).
  More than 30 civic groups and prominent individuals from across the globe voiced their strong opposition to the proposal.
  In a joint statement released last month, they called the proposal a “brazen insult” to victims of Suharto’s 32-year authori­tarian regime.
  Included in the coalition were the Commission for Missing Per­sons and Victims of Violence, Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development and Africa Network for Environment and Economic Justice.
  They asserted that honouring Suharto as a national hero would “significantly undermine Indo­­­nesia’s commitment to up­hold human rights in the inter­­­­natio­nal community”.
  “Granting the title of national hero to a perpetrator of crimes against humanity would constitute a betrayal for victims and survivors of past human rights violations, many of whom have yet to receive recognition, justice or reparations,” the groups said in the statement.
  The groups also pointed to a review issued last year by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which criticised Indo­nesia for its “continuing lack of accountability for past gross human rights violations”, inclu­ding the nation’s “failure to clarify the outcomes of investigations into atrocities during 1965-1966 and 1997-1998”.
  Both periods refer to what observers have called Indonesia’s deadliest years.
  An anti-communist purge led to killings of between 500,000 and three million members and sympathisers of the Indonesian Communist Party between 1965 and 1966, according to figures from the National Commission on Human Rights.
  The party was blamed for the alleged failed coup attempt launched against then-president Sukar­no on Sept 30, 1965.
  Suharto, an army general, led the military’s attempt to restore security and impose order.
  He was appointed the country’s acting president by the Provisional People’s Consultative Assembly (MPRS) in 1967, as Sukarno lay in bed with sickness.
  MPRS inaugurated Suharto as president a year later.
  Meanwhile, the period of 1997-1998 refers to the forced disappearance of dozens of pro-­democracy activists by the military.
  The kidnappings were closely tied to the lead up of the 1997 elections and the 1998 People’s Consultative Assembly general session, which at the time was discussing the replacement of Suharto.
  In the statement, the groups also referred to the 2016 Inter­national People’s Tribunal in The Hague, which concluded that the Indonesian military, under Suhar­to’s command, played a central role in the massacre of hundreds of thousands of people accused of being communists or its sympathisers between 1965 and 1966.
  “The attempt to honour Suharto as a national hero is a reflection of how political power continues to reproduce itself by sanitising the past and erasing the memory of state-sponsored violence and repression,” the groups said.
  In addition to the human rights record, the coalition also cited Suharto as one of the most corrupt leaders, citing Transparency International’s reports that the former president allegedly embez­zled up to US$35bil during his 32-year regime.
  The civic groups also referred to reports from the World Bank and UN-backed anti-graft bodies that described Suharto’s regime as a period marked by entrenched nepotism and institutional decay.
  “Suharto bears responsibility for the institutionalisation of corruption through the deliberate weakening of state institutions,” the group’s statement said, adding that his administration entren­ched “cronyism and corruption among the business elite”.
  The coalition calls on the government to reject the proposal and instead focus on resolving past gross human rights violations committed during Suharto’s presidency, as well as acts of collusion, corruption and nepotism in accordance with international community recommendations.
  They also urged Social Affairs Minister Saifullah Yusuf and TP2GP to “engage in transparent, inclusive and accountable communication” regarding the nomination of Indonesia’s national heroes.
  It remains unclear who nominated Suharto in the first place.
  Representatives of civic groups, including lawyer Airlangga Julio of Amar Law Firm and Public Interest Law Office, met with Saifullah last month.
  During the meeting, the ministry’s representative said the proposal was raised by Central Java Governor Ahmad Luthfi earlier this year, as reported by Kompas.id.
  But Luthfi denied that he had proposed to the Social Affairs Ministry to bestow Suharto with a national hero title, as quoted by Kompas.com.
  Under a 2012 ministerial regulation, a proposal to nominate a national hero must pass several levels of review before reaching the Social Affairs Ministry.
  The ministry will then bring the shortlisted names to the board of decorations and honorary titles for examination before final app­roval is given by the sitting president around the time of Heroes Day on Nov 10.
  This is not the first time for Suharto to be nominated as a national hero, as similar attempts took place at least twice in 2010 and 2015. — The Jakarta Post/ANN

LAVISH banquets featuring gourmet delicacies, rare ingredients and fine wines – once a symbol of status and power among China’s political elite – are steadily fading into history.
  This cultural shift stems from a far-reaching anti-corruption campaign led by the Communist Party of China (CPC) aimed at curbing wasteful public spending and enhancing transparency at all levels of government.
  Launched in 2012 with the introduction of the Eight-Point Regulation, the campaign has gained momentum over the years. It tackles not only financial misconduct but also the excesses historically associated with political and corporate privilege.
  The policy marked a turning point in how party officials are expected to conduct themselves, targeting long-standing problems such as extravagance, bureaucracy, and formalism.
  It imposes strict limits on spending for official perks, including receptions and banquets.
  “Thirteen years on, these policies have delivered significant results in stamping out corruption and unhealthy practices within the party,” said Prof Zhao Gangyin, director of the Party Building Department at the Shanghai Party Institute of the CPC.
  Prof Zhao noted that China has seen a sharp drop in government spending on official vehicles, overseas trips, and receptions.
  In 2023, only 59.7% (3.87bil yuan) of the allocated 6.496bil yuan (RM3.8bil) budget for these three categories was used. This contrasts sharply with 2011, when 99.3% (9.364bil yuan) of the 9.428bil yuan (RM5.6bil) budget was utilised, and 2012, when 98.6% (7.984bil yuan) of the 8.095bil yuan (RM4.78bil)budget was spent.
  And Shanghai, a city widely seen as a barometer for nationwide policy enforcement, has implemented strict protocols for official receptions.
  According to Prof Zhao, the standard meal allowance for visiting officials is now capped at 100 yuan per person per day.
  “A working meal can be arranged, if necessary, and the cost must not exceed 150 yuan per guest and 50 yuan (RM30) for each support staff,” he said.
  The number of accompanying staff allowed at official banquets meanwhile is limited to one-third of the total number of guests.
  “If there are only 10 guests or fewer, only three staff members may dine together,” he explained.
  For foreign guests, the daily meal allowance is set at 600 yuan (RM354) for each head of state or government, and 550 yuan for vice-president, deputy prime minister as well as parliamentary speaker or deputy levels.
  “Ministers and vice-ministers are allocated 500 yuan each, while the allowance for others stands at 300 yuan,” he added.
  Prof Zhao shared this information during a briefing session for a delegation of political party leaders from Asean recently.
  The Malaysian delegation included DAP vice-chairman Teo Nie Ching, national organising secretary Khoo Poay Tiong, assistant national organising secretary Lee Chin Chen, and Progressive Democratic Party information chief Joshua Ting Fu Ying.
  As Beijing intensifies its efforts to regulate official conduct, strict regulations are expected to remain a key feature of China’s broader governance and reform strategy. Last month, a revised version of the Regulations on Strictly Enforcing Thrift and Fighting Waste in Party and Government Organs was issued, underscoring China’s commitment to promoting frugality amid economic challenges.
  Further elaborating on the Eight-Point Regulation, Prof Zhao said it also emphasises closer ties between party officials and the public, simplicity in communication and governance, and an improved work ethic.
  Officials are instructed to reduce unnecessary overseas trips, cut large entourages, streamline traffic arrangements, and shorten meetings.
  Since 2013, the CPC’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Commission of Supervision have published monthly data on regulation violations to ensure continued oversight.
  To date, more than one million cases have been investigated, with disciplinary actions and punishments taken against numerous officials.
  Last year alone saw a record 225,275 cases reported, the highest annual figure to date. This compares with 136,307 cases in 2019; 119,224 in 2020; and 107,547 in 2022.
  In the first quarter of this year alone, 63,728 cases were reported, leading to criticism or discipline for 84,323 individuals. Another 55,886 were subject to formal party or administrative disciplinary action.
  Of the reported cases, 31,442 were linked to bureaucracy and formalism, including lack of public engagement, inefficiency, and actions detrimental to public interest or placing burdens on grassroots communities.
  Another 32,286 involved hedonism and extravagance, such as accepting expansive gifts, attending lavish banquets, unauthorised distribution of subsidies or welfare benefits, and personal use of public funds.
  Teo, who is also Malaysia’s Deputy Communications Minister, said the briefing offered valuable insight for a party that has transitioned from Opposition to government as DAP has done.
  “Having spent nearly six decades playing the role of Opposi-tion, adapting to governance is a significant transition,” she said.
  As she put it, being the second largest party in Parliament brings not only influence but also the challenge of maintaining internal discipline and integrity.
  DAP, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this year, could explore plans to set up its own party school to help build internal capacity and discipline, she said.
  (From left) Lee, Teo, Khoo and Ting visiting the site of CPC’s first national congress.
  The visit to the Shanghai Party Institute was held in conjunction with the CPC in Dialogue with Political Parties of Neighbouring Countries forum in Beijing last month.
  The delegates also visited a historic building in Shanghai where the first CPC National Congress was held in 1921. The meeting then was abruptly cut short when the 13 founding members were exposed and forced to flee for safety. A few days later, the congress resumed on a boat in Zhejiang province, about 100km away, where the members officially declared the founding of the party.
  In Beijing, the delegates also visited Shougang Park, a multipurpose development hub transformed from a former iron and steel factory – a testament to China’s urban renewal efforts.

  Shared future 
  The two-day dialogue, themed “Building a Community with a Shared Future with Neighbouring Countries: Political Parties in Action”, brought together more than 200 leaders from over 40 political parties, along with government officials, think tanks, media, and business representatives. It was hosted by the International Department of the CPC Central Committee.
  Founded in 1921 with just over 50 members, the CPC has grown into the world’s second-largest political party, with 99.185 million members as of 2023.
  Women make up 30.4% (or 30.19 million) of the membership.
  The largest age group within the party, making up 31.78% or nearly 31.52 million members, is between 31 and 45 years old. Meanwhile, 12.51% (about 12.41 million members) are aged 30 and below.
  Responding to a Thai delegate’s concern over regional tensions between China and the United States, the CPC Central Committee’s International Department minister Liu Jianchao said China did not want its neighbouring countries to take sides.
  “China would want to be a country that maintains a very friendly relationship with its neighbours.
  "We don’t want to put them in a situation where they have to choose a side, and we hope the other country will do the same,” he said.
  Liu also addressed a common saying that “one turns to the US for security and to China for development”.
  Disagreeing with this, he said regional security could not be guaranteed by a third party.
  “We rely on ourselves for security, rely on our consensus and our philosophy for peace,” he said.
  While acknowledging that China provides development opportunities, Liu said that the country, too, has benefited from the cooperation.
  Also invited to the event were MCA vice-president Datuk Tan Teik Cheng and central committee member Datuk Koh Chin Han, as well as Amanah vice-president Datuk Dr Mohd Hatta Ramli.
  A joint initiative outlining several key points of consensus, reflecting broad support for a vision of strengthened ties across political, economic, and cultural dimensions was adopted. In the document, participants affirmed a shared commitment to regional peace, stability, and development with political parties identified as essential forces in this process.
  The participants, from both ruling governments and the opposition, agreed that their roles as policy leaders and public opinion shapers give them the ability and responsibility to promote regional unity.
  The joint initiative also reaffirmed support for multilateralism and economic globalisation while pledging a firm rejection of unilateralism, protectionism, and “economic bullying”.

MARSEILLE
:
Marseille announced today they had signed defender Conrad Jaden Egan-Riley on a free transfer from Burnley.
“The 22-year-old English Under-21 international defender has joined the club after successfully completing his medical,” said the Ligue 1 club on their website.
Egan-Riley came through the youth system at Manchester City before joining Burnley.
After loan spells at Hibernian in Scotland and PSV Eindhoven, he became a first team regular as Burnley won promotion to the Premier League last season.
He was selected to the Championship team of the season.
Marseille described Egan-Riley as “solid and composed in build-up play”, and as “versatile and capable of playing both centrally and on the right side of defence”.
Egan-Riley is with the England Under-21 squad at the European championship in Slovakia and was an unused substitute as they opened their title defence with a 3-1 win over the Czechs.
Egan-Riley is Marseille’s second summer signing, following another out-of-contract Englishman, midfielder Angel Gomes from Lille.
The summer transfer window officially opens in France tomorrow, after an initial 10-day window on June 1-10, linked to the Club World Cup.

PETALING JAYA: Bekas tonggak pertahanan Sabah FC, Park Tae-su menyelar sikap tidak profesional pasukan itu berkenaan status kontraknya.
  Bagaimanapun, pemain kelahiran Korea Selatan itu akur dengan keputusan Sabah FC yang tidak menyenaraikan namanya pada musim depan.
  Pemain berusia 35 tahun itu, turut menitipkan nasihat kepada pengurusan Sang Badak supaya bersikap lebih profesional apabila berurusan dengan pemain.
  “Terima kasih Sabah FC, walaupun pahit saya tetap telan kerana ini adalah sebahagian ataupun lumrah bola sepak. Cuma saya harap di masa depan, kelab boleh bersikap lebih profesional dalam melayan kami sebagai pemain, kami juga manusia.
  “Saya masuk Sabah FC dengan cara yang baik di 2019, harapan saya untuk keluar dari pasukan juga dengan cara yang sama. Tapi dari bulan Januari, janji untuk duduk semeja dengan saya berbincang.
  “Masa demi masa saya tunggu kerana setia dan sayang saya dengan pasukan (tidak mencari peluang/pasukan lain). Tidak ada jawapan cuma, Nanti kita jumpa. Bila musim sudah tamat, saya tanya lagi masih sunyi sepi,” katanya dalam satu hantaran di Instagram Story miliknya.
  Tae-su menjadi sebahagian daripada 13 orang pemain yang dilepaskan Sang Badak selepas tamat Liga Malaysia (Liga M) musim 2024/25.
  Selain Tae-su, Sabah turut melepaskan Irfan Fazail, Saddil Ramdani, Telmo Castanheira dan Haris Stamboulidis.
  Ada dalam kalangan mereka sudah bersama kita selama bertahun-tahun dan sumbangan mereka cukup bermakna kepada kelab.
  “Kami amat menghargai segala-galanya. Anda akan sentiasa menjadi sebahagian daripada keluarga Sabah FC. Selamat Maju Jaya!,” kata kelab dalam satu kenyataan.
  Selain pemain itu, Sabah turut memilih tidak mengekalkan Hanafie Tokyo, Ummareng Bacok, Ramzi Mustakim, Nureizkhan Isa, Hamran Peter, Danial Haqim dan Sahrizan Saidin bagi mengharungi saingan musim depan.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 (Bernama) -- Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil today wished all fathers a Happy Father's Day.
  “To all the fathers who are always sacrificing for the happiness of their families, Happy Father’s Day. You are our hero. Your deeds can never be repaid.
  “May the love and sacrifices of fathers continue to be a source of strength and inspiration for all of us. Thank you for everything,” he wrote in a Facebook post.
  Meanwhile, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Federal Territories) Datuk Seri Dr Zaliha Mustafa also shared a Father’s Day message on Facebook, dedicated to her father, Mustafa Mohd Salleh, and her husband, Dr Ahmad Adzlan Musa.
  “A father’s crucial role in building a strong family must be appreciated. As a daughter, I am grateful to my father, Mustafa Mohd Salleh, who raised us siblings with sincere and honest values.
  “As a wife and mother, I see how my husband, Dr Ahmad Adzlan Musa, fulfils his role as a father to our children. Calm, patient and always there when needed. A father’s role does not stop at providing; he must also offer emotional support and be a partner in raising children in today’s increasingly challenging world,” she added.
  Deputy Communications Minister Teo Nie Ching described a father’s role as the head of the family — someone who bears the heavy responsibility of shaping his children’s future, while also being a protector, guide, and source of strength.
  “Today we celebrate those who rarely ask for praise, yet always give unconditionally — and we call him father. A father’s love is forever. Grateful today and every day for you. Happy Father's Day,” she wrote on Facebook.
  Deputy Entrepreneur Development and Cooperatives Minister Datuk Seri R. Ramanan also took to Facebook to extend Father’s Day wishes to all the great men who hold the title of father.
  “Today, we celebrate the true heroes in our lives — ayah, bapa, appa, papa, daddy. He is the shoulder to lean on, and although he may speak little, his love is never lacking. Silently he sacrifices, and despite his exhaustion, he endures.
  “In silence, he teaches by example. In weariness, he still smiles for the family. Without many words, his love remains forever, he is the true hero in our lives,” he wrote.

MELAKA: The Melaka Chief Minister pays tribute to his late father, Yusoh bin Mohd, in conjunction with Father's Day, describing him as the "Captain" of his life who shaped his journey and values.
  "I will remember him for the rest of my life for his unwavering devotion to my siblings and me," said Datuk Seri Ab Rauf Yusoh in a message to The Star on Sunday (June 15).
  He said Father's Day is a meaningful occasion to honour the heroes who play a vital role in shaping families and society.
  Ab Rauf said a father's role goes beyond providing for the household.
  "He is also a leader, protector, and mentor to his children. This year the state government has chosen the theme, 'Ayahku Kapten Keluarga' (My Father, the Captain of the Family) as a Father's Day celebration," he said.
  He noted that the theme reflects the steadfastness and resilience of fathers in steering their families through life's joys and challenges.
  "I wish all fathers in Melaka, across Malaysia, and around the world a heartfelt Happy Father's Day. Let us continue to cherish and emulate a father's strength, love, and leadership," he added.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 (Bernama) -- In a heartfelt Father’s Day message, Deputy Prime Ministers Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof paid tribute to fathers nationwide for their unwavering love and quiet sacrifices that shape families and strengthen society.
  Both leaders likened fathers to the “captain of the family,” a steadfast figure who navigates life’s challenges to steer loved ones safely forward.
  In a Facebook post, Ahmad Zahid reflected that a father’s love is seldom spoken but is present in every effort, prayer and drop of sweat shed without complaint.
  “Behind a calm face and steady steps lie countless sacrifices. He may say little, yet his presence shields the family, his strength carries them, and his love binds them together.”
  He added that every man who fulfils a paternal role—be it father, grandfather, uncle or other father‑figure—is “the anchor in life’s storm, the strength of the family and the backbone of the nation.”
  Ahmad Zahid, who is also Rural and Regional Development Minister, urged Malaysians to cherish their fathers while they still can, embracing them with love, and offering heartfelt prayers for those who have passed on.
  In a separate post, Fadillah highlighted this year’s Father’s Day theme, ‘Ayahku Kapten Keluarga’ (My Father, the Captain of the Family), which captures the pivotal role of fathers as protectors and pillars of strength.
  “A father always wants the best for his family—safety, happiness, completeness—even if it means sacrificing everything he has,” said Fadillah, who is also Minister of Energy Transition and Water Transformation.
  Fadillah noted that fathers are not only providers but role‑models of character and virtue, offering unconditional love and tireless devotion without expecting anything in return.
  He added that Islam accords high esteem to filial piety, with Qur’anic verses highlighting the duty to honour and thank both parents, especially the father.
  “May Allah SWT make us righteous sons and daughters, ever devoted to our parents in life and in death. Happy Father’s Day,” read the post.

KOLKATA: It was in May 1955 that a British mountaineering team successfully climbed Kangchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain at 8,586m, for the first time.
  But members of this expedition did not step onto the peak of the mountain on the border of Nepal and India. They instead stopped about 1.5m short of the summit, in deference to the wishes of locals in the region, who venerate this Himalayan mountain and did not want the climbers to sully its sacred peak by stepping onto it.
  More than 70 years later, locals in the small Indian state of Sikkim, which lies in the heart of the Himalayas between Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet, are fuming over a mountaineering team having done just that.
  A team comprising representatives from the Indian and Nepalese armies scaled Kangchenjunga’s peak in two waves on May 19 and 20, as part of the Indian government’s Har Shikhar Tiranga (Hindi for “A Tricolour Atop Every Peak”) initiative aimed at hoisting the Indian national flag on the highest point in all 28 Indian states.
  The expedition, which flagged off on March 26, was organised by the National Institute of Mountaineering and Adventure Sports (Nimas), which functions under India’s Ministry of Defence and is based in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh.
  As the Indian side of the mountain remains closed to climbers, the team approached it from Nepal.
  Nevertheless, the ascent to the top of Kangchenjunga has angered locals in Sikkim, particularly members of the Bhutia and Lepcha communities, most of whom are Buddhists and consider the mountain as a guardian deity who has watched over them and their land for generations.
  “They have defiled the sanctity of our Kangchenjunga,” said Tseten Tashi Bhutia, the convenor of Sikkim Bhutia Lepcha Apex Committee (Siblac) – an organisation that represents the rights and interests of these two communities – and a former minister with a previous state government in Sikkim.
  The controversy has ignited concerns that the centuries-old religious and cultural traditions of indigenous Buddhist communities in Sikkim, India’s second-smallest state with a population of around 632,000, were disregarded to generate patriotic fervour.
  It also highlighted the power dynamics between the central government, which organised the climb, and the state government, which expressly prohibits any climb atop Kangchenjunga.
  Sikkim has maintained a formal climbing ban atop Kangchenjunga since 2001, one that followed another controversy in 2000 when the state government allowed an Austrian team to attempt the near-vertical trek up the peak in exchange for US$20,000. The team failed to make it to the summit.
  “Whatever has happened, has happened. Now damage control has to be done,” Bhutia told The Straits Times, stressing the need for a “purification ritual” to placate their guardian deity. He also called for an apology from the climbers as well as the central government that organised the climb and the state government that failed to stop it.
  “This type of blunder should also not be repeated in the future,” he added.
  Neither the climbers nor the Indian government has issued any statement following the controversy. ST approached Nimas for a comment but did not receive a response.
  On June 12, Siblac issued a statement saying that the recent climb had “deeply hurt the religious and cultural sentiments” of the Bhutias and Lepchas, and formally called for an apology.
  The Lepchas believe they are descendants of ancestors who were created out of the snow of the holy Kangchenjunga.
  Locals in the state also celebrate their unique relationship with the mountain during Pang Lhabsol, an annual festival that commemorates the consecration of Kangchenjunga as the guardian deity of Sikkim.
  Siblac will organise a Buddhist purification ritual on June 15 at the Kabi Lungchok sacred grove in North Sikkim to seek the deity’s forgiveness and “restore the spiritual harmony and sanctity of our land”.
  It was at this historic forest site that the Blood Brotherhood Treaty was signed between the Lepchas and Bhutias in the 13th century, marking the beginning of Sikkim’s unified rule. Kangchenjunga was invoked as a witness to the signing of this key treaty.
  Locals fear angering their guardian deity could cause natural disasters, something the state has often been afflicted with. On June 1, a landslide hit the site of an army camp in Sikkim following days of heavy rains, killing at least six individuals.
  Anger following the ascent has been widespread in Sikkim. A video of Sikkimese children pleading with everyone not to climb their revered mountain has been circulating online and even Sikkim’s Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang, who heads the state government, expressed his concern.
  He wrote to India’s Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah on May 24 describing the recent ascent as “a violation of both the prevailing legal provisions and the deeply held religious beliefs of the people of Sikkim”.
  Sikkim has maintained a formal climbing ban atop not just Kangchenjunga but also eight other sacred peaks since 2001. However, ascents are made from time to time from the Nepalese side of Kangchenjunga.
  But Bhutia said the expedition team, irrespective of their approach path, had violated the sacred peak.
  “They have blown the law (preventing any ascent on Kangchenjunga) to smithereens,” he said.
  In his letter, Tamang also urged the Indian government to convince Nepal to ensure that no further expeditions are permitted on Kangchenjunga.
  The demand for such a climbing restriction is not unique. China, for instance, prevents any climbing activity on Mount Kailash in Tibet, given its deep religious significance for followers of not just Buddhism, but also Hinduism, Jainism and Bon, an indigenous religion practised in Tibet.
  Even Nepal, which has otherwise embraced mountain tourism enthusiastically, bans climbing on Machhapuchhare, an iconic 6,993m mountain whose name translates to “fishtail” and which is revered by local Gurung people.
  Jiwan Rai, a political commentator based in Sikkim’s capital Gangtok, said it is important to view Kangchenjunga similarly through a “time-honoured Sikkimese lens”, one that does not consider the mountain as a “trophy for adventurers” but a symbol of cultural heritage and “the pinnacle of religious identity” for a significant section of the state’s people.
  “This centuries-old indigenous world view now stands desecrated for the sake of some thrill to be felt by army personnel. Isn’t that a massive cultural cost?” Rai told ST.
  Furthermore, the recent ascent of Kangchenjunga is being seen as an affront to not just Sikkimese cultural and religious values, but also their political rights.
  Rai added that the Sikkim state government had failed to uphold its rights by not preventing the Indian government-led climb despite its official ban on any ascent atop Kangchenjunga.
  “This lapse reveals the current government’s inability to withstand pressure from the centre. The only way to disprove this perception is by firmly demanding recompense for the violation of law and redress for the cultural sacrilege,” he said.
  The state is currently governed by the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM), a regional party that Chief Minister Tamang leads as its president. The SKM is part of the National Democratic Alliance government at the centre, led by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
  Siblac had opposed the ascent publicly as early as April, with a letter sent to the state’s Governor O. P. Mathur, requesting him to call off the expedition. The governor of an Indian state is appointed by the Indian president on the advice of the prime minister and serves as its constitutional head, taking decisions based on the advice of the chief minister and council of ministers.
  Said Rai: “A widespread perception is emerging that India is steering towards a uniform national identity, and a state with its distinct personality like Sikkim comes in the way. If Sikkim does not make its voice heard now, it risks losing its unique identity to India’s broader and increasingly homogenised national narrative.” - The Straits Times/ANN

  KUANTAN, June 15 — Two people were killed and two others injured in a collision involving a car and a trailer lorry on Jalan Kuantan-Maran highway yesterday afternoon.
  The crash, which occurred at Batu 12 around 3:30 pm, is believed to have happened when the lorry, travelling from Johor towards Kuantan, lost control and swerved into oncoming traffic before colliding with a Toyota Vios.
  Kuantan police chief, ACP Wan Mohd Zahari Wan Busu said Norihan Mustafa, 57, a passenger in the back seat of the car, died at the scene.
  The lorry driver, 24-year-old Jayavarman Murugan, was taken to Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital (HTAA) but later died in the emergency ward.
  The car, which was heading towards Maran from Kuantan, was carrying three people. The driver, Mohd Ridzwan Ab Mubin, 59, sustained facial and shoulder injuries, while another passenger escaped with minor injuries.
  Both vehicles are being inspected by the Computerised Vehicle Inspection Centre (PUSPAKOM) and the case is being investigated under Section 41(1) of the Road Transport Act 1987, which covers dangerous driving causing death.

KUALA TERENGGANU: A trader here lost over RM175,000 after falling victim to a scam involving a nonexistent order for goods.
  Kuala Terengganu OCPD Supt Azli Mohd Noor said that on June 3, the 50-year-old victim was contacted by his foster brother, who said he had been offered a project to supply sports equipment to Kolej Universiti Bestari (KUB) in Setiu.
  The foster brother said he had to decline the offer, purportedly from a ministry office in Putrajaya, owing to financial constraints and instead passed it on to the victim.
  "The victim agreed to take up the project to deliver the goods to KUB on June 8.
  "Subsequently, he received a call from a woman claiming to be from the same office, who requested additional items such as dates, traditional daggers and decorative plates.
  "She also provided contact details of several so-called suppliers,” he said in a statement on Sunday (June 15).
  Supt Azli said the victim contacted the alleged suppliers and subsequently made payments in stages totalling RM175,452.80 to several bank accounts they provided.
  However, the victim later discovered that the woman was not affiliated with the ministry and that the said order did not exist.
  "The victim lodged a police report on Saturday (June 14).
  "The payments were made using his savings and funds from a business partner,” Supt Azli said.
  The case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating. – Bernama

KANGAR: Bola sepak Perlis kembali mengaum selepas Perlis Guar Syed Alwi (GSA) FC mendapat ‘lampu hijau’ untuk beraksi dalam saingan Liga A1 Semi Pro pada musim depan.
  Pasukan itu yang dikenali sebagai GSA FC sebelum ini layak secara merit selepas menjuarai Liga A2 dan penampilan di ke Liga A1 bakal menghidupkan semula bola sepak Perlis.
  Jika muncul selaku pencabar di Liga A1, tidak mustahil harapan untuk melihat pasukan dari Perlis kembali beraksi dalam Liga Super menjadi kenyataan pada musim akan datang.
  Presiden Perlis GSA FC, Izizam Ibrahim berkata, pengesahan penyertaan ke Liga A1 itu telah dimaklumkan oleh Persatuan Bola Sepak Malaysia (FAM) dan Liga Bola Sepak Amatur (AFL).
  Izizam yang juga Exco kerajaan negeri berkata, kerajaan negeri dan Menteri Besar sendiri berkemungkinan bakal mengumumkan inisiatif lain khususnya daripada segi bantuan.
  “Alhamdulillah, semua dipermudahkan. Saya boleh umumkan,]kita sah sudah masuk Liga A1. Insya-Allah selepas ini, kita akan usaha cari dan membuka peluang kepada mana-mana pihak ingin membantu pasukan ini,” katanya.
  Sebanyak 12 pasukan akan mewarnai Liga A1 iaitu Armed Forces FC, Manjung City FC, Imigresen FC II, Johor Darul Ta’zim II, Selangor FC II, Kelantan WTS FC, Kedah FA, Machan FC, Kelantan Red Warriors FC, Bunga Raya FC, Malaysian University, Persatuan Bolasepak Perak (PAFA).
  Manakala tiga pasukan diberikan kelulusan bersyarat bagi membolehkan mereka turut sama menyertai saingan Liga A1 Semi Pro musim ini iaitu Kedah Darul Aman (KDA), Perlis GSA FC dan Seoul Phoenix FC (Korea Selatan) yang berpangkalan di Lembah Klang.
  Lewat 1990-an sehingga 2010, Perlis bukanlah asing dalam arena bola sepak negara dengan Singa Utara ketika itu cukup disegani lawan selain pernah dianggap ‘giant killer’ yang memusnahkan pasukan besar.
  Dalam era kegemilangan tersebut, Perlis juga pernah merasai nikmat menjuarai Piala Malaysia pada 2004 dan 2006 serta Liga Super 2005 selain menjadi pencabar utama kepada pasukan-pasukan hebat lain di negara ini.
  Malah, dari 2004 hingga 2008 khususnya, Perlis sering kali berada di pentas akhir saingan dengan antaranya menjulang Piala Malaysia selain membawa pulang Piala Sumbangsih sebanyak dua kali.-UTUSAN

BEIJING/HONG KONG: Boeing delivered a new 787-9 aircraft to China's Juneyao Airlines on Saturday (June 14), Chinese media outlet Yicai reported, as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington ease.
  The delivery comes two days after a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board crashed in a fireball shortly after takeoff in western India.
  Boeing and Juneyao Airlines did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment on the Yicai report.
  The US aerospace giant had suspended new aircraft deliveries to China in April as President Donald Trump's tariff war escalated between the world's two largest economies.
  Boeing said at the end of May that deliveries would resume this month after the tariffs were temporarily scaled back for 90 days.
  China and the US concluded two days of negotiations in London on Tuesday to resolve key trade issues in the two superpowers' bruising tariff war, where negotiators from Washington and Beijing agreed on a framework covering tariff rates.
  On Monday, a new Boeing 737 MAX painted in the livery of Xiamen Airlines landed in China, adding to signs that the planemaker was resuming deliveries to China. The country represents about ten per cent of Boeing's commercial backlog and is an important and growing aviation market.
  Boeing had previously said customers in China would not take delivery of new planes due to the tariffs and that it was looking to resell potentially dozens of aircraft. - Reuters

You might think that abusive bosses act out of anger or stress. Think again. An American study reveals that some of them deliberately mistreat their teams to assert their authority or boost performance. And, contrary to what you might think, they feel no remorse.
  From offices to construction sites, toxic management poisons many professional environments with behavior like shouting, humiliation, inappropriate comments and more.
  However, a study conducted by researchers at the University of Georgia (UGA) is challenging our understanding of this phenomenon. This kind of abusive behavior does not always signal a loss of control, due to stress or tiredness, for example. Some managers use it as a carefully calculated strategy.
  This insight came to Szu-Han Lin, professor of management at UGA's Terry College of Business, while watching “Hell's Kitchen.” In this television show, two teams of chefs compete for a position as head chef in a restaurant.
  This all takes place under the watchful eye and, above all, the harsh comments of British chef Gordon Ramsay. Over the course of the episodes, we see him yelling, humiliating, and sometimes even insulting the contestants. For hours on end. Millions of viewers watch this spectacle without batting an eye. Szu-Han Lin, however, saw it as a subject of study.
  Her team interviewed 100 supervisors from various sectors, including construction, nursing, and retail. Then, in a second phase, 249 other managers were monitored daily for two weeks. The question was simple: why do you mistreat your employees? And how do you feel afterward?
  When abuse becomes a management tool 
  Their answers are disturbing. Some supervisors openly admit to using shouting and humiliation as management tools to enforce compliance or assert their authority. And unlike those who crack under pressure, these managers feel no guilt. Worse still, they feel a sense of satisfaction. "If they engage in these behaviors with a goal in mind, like boosting compliance or preserving their identity as leaders, they’re satisfying an emotional need," explains Szu-Han Lin in a news release.
  This discovery challenges two decades of research on the subject. "We have been studying abusive behavior in the workplace for 20 years, and we have known it always has bad outcomes for performance and productivity," the researcher says. "But we also know that people keep doing it. I think we assumed that if managers engage in these behaviors, they’d feel bad, and it would always have a negative effect on them. But that’s not the case."
  For Szu-Han Lin, this new awareness must change the way managers are trained. "It’s important for leaders to recognize they may have motivations for acting abusively to help them find better leadership tools," she explains. "You may want your followers to listen to you, or you may want to make sure you establish your role as a leader. That’s fine, but there are other ways to achieve that."
  Regardless of the motivations, managerial mistreatment remains counterproductive. It destroys motivation instead of stimulating it. "If you engage in abusive behaviors, it will always lead to negative outcomes. No one will be motivated at all," says Szu-Han Lin. A lesson that should give pause to anyone who thinks that authority goes hand in hand with brutality. – ETX Daily Up

Dozens of countries at the UN oceans summit on Tuesday took a first step toward recognising an invisible but growing threat to marine life – underwater noise pollution.
  The din created by shipping and other human activities is rising at an alarming rate, marine conservation groups say, a major problem for sea life reliant on sound below water to survive.
  Whales and dolphins use clicks and whistles to communicate with their young, navigate the oceans and warn of danger and hunt for food.
  "Human noise pollution is drowning out these vital sounds," said Carlos Bravo from OceanCare, a marine conservation group.
  In a step toward a quieter ocean, 37 countries led by Canada and Panama have launched a new effort to reduce harmful underwater noise pollution.
  At the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, ministers from these countries committed to advancing quieter shipping design and including noise reduction protocols in their marine protected areas.
  "Too often, the issue of ocean noise has been sidelined in global environmental discourse," said Panama's environment minister Juan Carlos Navarro.
  "With this coalition, we are committing to act decisively to protect marine biodiversity from this invisible yet powerful threat."
  Whirling propellers from shipping, sonar from navy vessels and construction noise from offshore industry all emit sounds that can travel vast distances underwater, WWF says.
  Beluga whales can detect sounds from icebreaking ships up to 85 kilometres (52 miles) away, causing panic and flight, it added. 
  Other marine mammals change their behaviour under acoustic stress, while smaller prey for these bigger ocean dwellers can also be scared off by human-made noise.
  One of the biggest contributors to underwater noise is cargo vessels, and cutting the acoustic footprint of the global shipping industry could have a major impact.
  Despite this, global efforts to reduce ocean noise "have been limited and fragmented", the coalition said.
  Bravo said this new coalition had taken a "crucial step towards giving marine life back their voice in the blue planet's symphony". — AFP

SAN FRANCISCO:  A single query to the AI software ChatGPT consumes as much electricity as roughly one second of baking something in an oven, according to the developer OpenAI.
  Meanwhile the water consumption from each query – owing to data centres needing to be cooled – comes down to about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman wrote in a blog post.
  Experts have for years been warnings about the massively escalating energy demands from the widespread use of AI services. While individual queries may require less energy due to efficiency gains in chip and server technology, the sheer volume of usage continues to drive a sharp increase in energy demand for AI data centres.
  Companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon are planning to rely on nuclear energy in the US to help meet this demand without proportionally increasing emissions of climate-damaging carbon dioxide.
  The need to cool data centres has also raised concerns about water consumption. In recent years, several studies have attempted to calculate the environmental impact of increased AI usage, but researchers must rely on numerous assumptions.
  Altman shared OpenAI's energy and water figures in a blog post in which he painted a generally positive picture of the future of AI.
  He acknowledged that there would be significant disruptions, such as the elimination of entire job categories. "But on the other hand the world will be getting so much richer so quickly that we’ll be able to seriously entertain new policy ideas we never could before."
  In recent years, the idea of a universal basic income, funded by productivity gains, has been discussed in connection with AI.
  According to the OpenAI chief executive, an average ChatGPT query consumes approximately 0.34 watt-hours of electricity ("about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes").
  He quantified the water consumption at 0.000085 gallons (0.00032176 litres). Altman did not provide further details about the basis for these calculations. – dpa

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -About 50 U.S. Marines squared off against hundreds of protesters in front of a federal building in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday, with the crowd yelling in unison for them to go home. 
  The Marines had been sent to the city by U.S. President Donald Trump along with federalized members of the California National Guard earlier this week over the objections of the state governor and the city's mayor, as anger over immigration raids drew thousands of demonstrators into the streets. 
  Jesus Arias, a Los Angeles-based attorney, was at the front of the crowd with a bullhorn, working to convince the Marines to abandon their post. 
  "We are not your enemy, we are the people!" Arias said into the bullhorn as the Marines looked on. "You are breaking the oaths you took to be Marines. Wake up! Wake up!"
  California Governor Gavin Newsom and local leaders have called Trump's move an inflammatory provocation for the protests over the past week - demonstrations that the local sheriff on Friday said were 99% peaceful, with a only a handful of people engaged in violence and vandalism.
  Trump summoned 700 Marines from California who were trained to help in the L.A. mission, including de-escalation and crowd control. 
  The deployment sparked a debate about the use of the military on U.S. soil given Marines are trained for conflicts around the world rather than at home, but the Trump administration has defended its move by citing the need to maintain law and order. Trump, who is carrying out a campaign promise to deport illegal immigrants, has argued that Los Angeles would have burned down if he had not acted quickly.
  The Marines were armed with M4 rifles and wore face shields and the same shin guards used by baseball catchers. They stood guard at the top of steps leading to the entrance of the Roybal federal building, which houses immigration offices and where ICE has held some undocumented detainees. The building has been a flashpoint for protesters all week. 
  Just down the steps about 15 feet away, hundreds of protesters confronted the Marines, yelling in unison "Marines go home!" and "Shame! Shame!"
  Several protesters hurled insults and invectives at the Marines, who did not react. Some in the crowd were telling them to take a knee or to join their demonstration. As of 4 p.m., there had been no physical altercation between the protesters and Marines. 
  Kai Ly, a 45-year-old a Los Angeles resident, was in the crowd. 
  "This is such a sad moment in time for the U.S.," Ly said. "It's sad to see that we're so divided that we have Marines heading off against protesters."  
  Antoinette Gutierrez, 36, was another Los Angeles resident protesting before the Marines. 
  "It's disgusting to have the military, to have the Marines, turned against citizens," she said. "It makes me embarrassed to be American."

SEPANG: Tabung Haji (TH) akan menjalankan kajian dan analisa terperinci bagi mengenal pasti punca kematian jemaah negara di Tanah Suci baru-baru ini yang kebanyakannya meninggal dunia akibat serangan jantung.
  Menteri di Jabatan Perdana Menteri (Hal Ehwal Agama), Datuk Dr. Mohd. Na’im Mokhtar berkata, kajian dan analisa itu penting sebagai persediaan operasi haji pada musim akan datang.
  Beliau berkata, majoriti jemaah yang meninggal dunia adalah dalam kalangan warga emas berusia antara 60 hingga 75 tahun.
  “Walaupun jumlah (kematian) ini kecil berbanding negara-negara lain, namun kita perlu lihat punca sebenar dan langkah penambahbaikan yang boleh dibuat untuk persediaan operasi haji tahun depan,” katanya selepas menyambut kepulangan kumpulan jemaah haji pertama di tanah air di Lapangan Terbang Antarabangsa Kuala Lumpur (KLIA), di sini malam tadi.
  Katanya, pihaknya masih belum dapat maklumat sama ada jemaah yang meninggal dunia itu mempunyai rekod penyakit jantung sebelum ini atau hanya dikesan ketika berada di Tanah Suci.
  Mohd Na’im berkata, maklumat lanjut akan dimaklumkan selepas laporan penuh daripada pasukan perubatan diperoleh.
  Mengulas lanjut, Mohd Na’im berkata, cuaca panas ekstrem di Tanah Suci baru-baru ini mungkin menjadi antara faktor penyumbang memandangkan suhu di Arafah pernah mencecah antara 48 hingga 50 darjah Celsius.
  Pada masa sama, katanya, beliau turut memuji sikap jemaah haji Malaysia yang mematuhi arahan kerajaan Arab Saudi supaya tidak keluar antara pukul 10 pagi hingga 4 petang.
  “Kebanyakan jemaah tidak keluar dan hanya berada dalam khemah yang dilengkapi penghawa dingin. Ini membantu mengurangkan risiko kesihatan akibat cuaca panas melampau,” katanya.
  Setakat hari ini, seramai 14 jemaah haji negara, iaitu sembilan lelaki dan lima perempuan berusia antara 47 hingga 78 tahun, meninggal dunia di Tanah Suci dengan 13 jemaah meninggal akibat serangan jantung dan seorang lagi akibat jangkitan kuman pada paru-paru. – UTUSAN

  Dear Dr G,
  My wife and I are in our early forties and have two teenage kids. We are both at the peak of our careers and look forward to the kids leaving for college soon.

SINGAPORE: She was on a conventional path to success, having done well enough at the Primary School Leaving Examination to get into the six-year Integrated Programme (IP), and even gained entry into the Art Elective Programme to pursue her interest in art.
  But in her fifth year of the IP at National Junior College, Elise Lim decided to put it all aside – to go into fashion.
  She had taken an interest in cosplay in the fourth year, and tried her hand at making character wigs and props, and tailoring costumes.
  Also feeling demotivated from not doing as well as she had hoped in secondary school, she made a switch to pursue a course in fashion design and management at Temasek Polytechnic (TP), something she had dreamt of exploring since her younger days. Not everyone would have approved of her decision.
  “It’s not common for people to drop out of the IP, and a lot of parents could be worried that this is an unstable future, which is true, because the design and art field is unstable,” Elise said, adding that junior college (JC) is typically seen as the “safe path” for students.
  Three years on, the 19-year-old, who is in her third year in polytechnic, has amassed more than 94,000 followers on TikTok, where she posts tutorials on how to make wigs, and other cosplay content.
  Her most viral video, where she cosplays the 2023 design of a virtual character named “magical mirai miku” with a self-made wig, has more than 12.9 million views. On Instagram, she has a following of 12,200.
  She takes commission orders for wigs via her Instagram page on a first come, first served basis, and in between juggling schoolwork, she sends out blasts to her followers to say she is free to take up projects.
  The prices of her wigs range from US$100 (S$130) to US$700.
  She has made more than 30 character wigs and more than ten props, some of which are commissioned orders for international customers.
  “I first started playing video games like Valorant and League Of Legends in secondary school, and afterwards I saw all these people online cosplaying these super-interesting-looking game characters,” she said.
  Realising how much commissioning good-quality cosplay wigs and props would cost, she decided to try making them on her own at the end of 2022.
  She did this by watching online tutorials, speaking to other cosplayers at conventions and looking for cheap supplies online.
  Her mother, who wanted to be known only as Mrs Lim, has been supportive of her decision to pursue an unconventional path.
  “I’m proud of Elise and generally supportive of her love for crafting... My main concern is her frequent exposure to chemicals when making wigs, and I hope she takes care to protect herself,” said the 52-year-old, who did not want to reveal her occupation.
  Elise’s father died when she was younger. She is an only child.
  When The Straits Times visited Elise’s work studio in her attic in April, more than five bright blue wigs were displayed on her work table.
  Equipped with a sewing machine and other tools, the room was also filled with various props she has made over the years.
  These include a one-metre-long shark-inspired rocket launcher and machine gun based on the ones belonging to the Arcane character, Jinx. The Arcane series is a science-fantasy show based on the League Of Legends game. Some other works-in-progress include a crochet top for a small crafting online business she runs and a drill-curl hairstyle wig for a League Of Legends character, Gwen.
  Her costume accessories and props are made with materials including ethylene-vinyl acetate foam and recycled materials such as cardboard tubes from online shopping platforms like Taobao where supplies are cheaper.
  When she is in a rush, she buys her materials from Chinatown.
  Sitting on a stool, Elise showed ST how she makes a wig – starting with a pre-coloured base wig bought online and trimming the synthetic hair to the desired length, keeping any excess hair for future use.
  A base wig is an unstyled wig that can be easily cut, coloured and styled to match a character’s specific hairstyle. Afterwards, she works on putting together an internal structure for the wig depending on the hairstyle needed.
  “I first started styling my wigs on soft toys, and after that I realised I should invest in a mannequin head,” she recalled with a laugh.
  “It’s very time-consuming – you have to work slowly because the glue needs time to dry, but it’s very easy to be impatient and want to move on to the next step,” she said, adding that the longest time she took to make a wig was 60 hours.
  “This is skilled labour, so I had to practise and learn, and train. And the cost of living in Singapore is also high, so I think my price is quite justified,” she said.
  People often reach out to her asking if she can make specific props, but she has difficulty putting a reasonable price on some of them as she has spent up to 90 hours making some, she added.
  Her goal in the long term is to open an independent commissioning studio with one of her cosplay friends, Jade Tang, 21. “We both get commission requests sometimes, so we think that if we continue to develop our skills, this is something we can do in the long run,” said Elise, who will graduate from polytechnic in a year.
  The polytechnic course curriculum aligns more with her interests, as she has more freedom to be creative and put her own personality into her works.
  “It’s more fruitful because the skills that I’ve learnt are more tangible. At the end of each module, you would have a very clear idea of what you gained from it,” Elise said.
  After graduating, she plans to take a gap year to enrol in short courses related to making clothes. She is also exploring studying costume design at an arts university in China, Belgium or Italy.
  “I want to go to an art university, so if I stayed in JC, my focus would be split between academics and the arts, and I would have come out the other end with nothing good. I would have no good academics or a good portfolio, and also wasted two years, so I switched to TP.”
  Speak to teachers, parents and others in the field before making decisions – this is Elise’s advice to young people wondering whether they should follow their dreams, including those out of the ordinary.
  “If they are confident they can earn (money) and have done research in their field, then there’s nothing wrong with doing something a bit more unconventional,” she said. - The Straits Times/ANN

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Daniel Suarez transformed disaster into triumph on Saturday, recovering from a morning crash to storm from last place to victory in NASCAR's Xfinity Series race, sending thousands of rain-drenched Mexican fans into ecstasy at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.
  The 33-year-old Monterrey native, who crashed during qualifying practice for the top-tier Cup Series, dusted himself off to claim a fairy-tale win in his homeland in a backup car against all odds.
  "I left my country 10 years ago to follow my dreams and pursue a career in NASCAR. I have never felt anything like this," Suarez, who in 2016 became the first foreign driver to win an Xfinity Series title, told reporters.
  "It's amazing that this race is actually happening here. This win is not only for me; it's for everyone who has worked on this in Mexico and the United States, and for everyone who believes in it and in me," he added.
  Suarez seized his opportunity during the chaotic restart in the final stage when his rivals Connor Zilisch and Ty Gibbs were eliminated in a multi-car collision.
  Although he secured the lead, it was not without challenge; a late restart after a red flag saw him fend off Taylor Gray and ultimately claim victory in the second-tier NASCAR series.
  "It's incredible to get this win in front of my home crowd and my people. Did you guys have fun? Viva Mexico," Suarez shouted to fans who had braved persistent rainfall throughout the day.
  Earlier, rain disrupted NASCAR's Cup Series qualifying, with New Zealand's Shane van Gisbergen mastering the treacherous conditions to secure pole position for Sunday's debut Cup race in Mexico.
  "What a really cool achievement for us," said van Gisbergen, steering his No. 88 Trackhouse Racing Chevrolet to the front of the grid.
  The weekend represents NASCAR's boldest international push in years, bringing America's premier motorsport to a nation where Formula One has traditionally dominated the racing landscape.

KUALA LUMPUR: Peminat Inteam berharap agar kumpulan itu dapat menganjurkan hari kedua bagi konsert Kasih Kekasih Inteam 25 Tahun yang bakal berlangsung September depan.
  Perkara itu berikutan kegagalan sebilangan besar peminat membuat tempahan sebaik sahaja tiket habis terjual dalam tempoh satu jam bermula tengahari semalam.
  “Saya tercongok depan laptop sejak pukul 11.30 pagi, tekan refresh berulang kali sampai pukul 12 tengahari. Saya tak dapat tekan mana-mana seat, habis teruk. Bertarung selama satu jam tiga puluh minit. Akhirnya kalah di hari jadi saya,” luah seorang peminat. 
  “Buatlah hari kedua, penat refresh dua jam,” komen seorang lagi peminat.
  Konsert Kasih Kekasih Inteam 25 yang akan berlangsung pada 28 September ini bertempat IdeaLive Arena, Petaling Jaya.
  Terdahulu, Inteam terpaksa mengubah tarikh dan lokasi asal konsert berkenaan iaitu 27 September di Zepp KL berikutan permintaan memberansangkan terhadap jualan tiket.
  Peminat dalam masa yang sama turut mencadangkan Inteam memindahkan konsert berkenaan ke lokasi lebih besar untuk memuatkan lebih ramai penonton.
  “Trafik dalam talian mencecah 80,000, buat di Stadium Bukit Jalil sahajalah.” tulis peminat.
  “Buatlah di stadium,” cadang seorang lagi peminat. – UTUSAN

KUANTAN, June 15 — An elderly couple was found dead in their home in a shophouse in Kampung Sungai Ruan, Raub, yesterday.
  Raub district police chief Superintendent Mohd Shahril Abd Rahman said the body of Wong Tong Seng, 75, was found lying in front of the kitchen sink and infested with maggots while the body of his wife, Loh Kam Ngo, 73, was found lying at the edge of the bed in one of the rooms.
  “The initial inspection found no elements of crime and the house was in good condition,” he said in a statement yesterday.
  He said further investigations and post-mortem results conducted at the Raub Hospital found that the cause of death for both victims was due to Acute Coronary Syndrome (heart attack).
  He also said that the woman had been suffering from Parkinson’s disease for the past 20 years, while her husband was reported to have received treatment for his heart at Klinik Kesihatan Ulu Gali, and the case was classified as sudden death. — Bernama

LONDON: Two young British girls were left orphaned by the Air India plane crash, after their father travelled to the south Asian country to scatter his wife's ashes.
  Arjun Patoliya was travelling home to his daughters, aged four and eight, after scattering the ashes of his wife Bharti, who had died just weeks earlier, when the plane crashed on Thursday (June 12).
  "The husband went to do the rituals in India and coming back, he was on board. He has left two little girls behind and the girls are now orphans," said Anjana Patel, the mayor of London's Harrow borough, at a multi-faith vigil for those killed in Thursday's plane crash.
  At least 279 people died - including passengers, crew members and people on the ground - when a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner bound for London's Gatwick Airport crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad, shortly after take-off.
  The victims included 52 Britons, 20 of whom are thought to have previously worshipped at Harrow's Siddhashram Shakti Centre, where the vigil was held.
  "I really hope that those girls will be looked after by all of us," Patel said.
  "We don't have any words to describe how the families and friends must be feeling, so what we can do is pray for them," she added.
  British man Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, 40, is believed to be the only person to have survived the crash. - AFP

KUCHING, Jun 14 (Bernama) -- Sarawak Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg today called upon the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sarawak (ACCCIS) to forge a closer partnership with the state government to accelerate Sarawak's economic growth.
  He said that the door is wide open for ACCCIS to collaborate with investors and assured the government's commitment to facilitate their initiatives.
  Speaking at the ACCCIS 60th Anniversary Gala Dinner yesterday, he said the state's current economic policy leverages its strength in sustainable energy, which is intended not only for export but also serves as a crucial draw for industrialists.
  "If they want to manufacture whatever product and need energy, if you are competitive and have sustainable energy, people (investors) will bring their money here. Actually, the door is now knocking on us. So, I hope that ACCCIS, we can work together," he said.
  He also commended ACCCIS for its six decades of significant contributions to Sarawak's economic development, acknowledging its enduring partnership with the government since 1965.
  Abang Johari said that there is a stark contrast between the past and present Sarawak’s economy, in which the state was basically dependent on timber for revenue, and this had led to a lot of trees being cut down.
  He praised the resilience and foresight of the business community, including ACCCIS, for their role in diversifying Sarawak's economic activities over the years.
  "But of course, the business community, the people who are very resilient, and you, look forward to diversifying your economic activities as time goes by,” he added.
  Also present at the dinner were Deputy Premier Datuk Amar Dr Sim Kui Hian and ACCCIS President Kong Chiong Ung.

The painter Norman Rockwell was known for his depictions of calm, domestic life in America, but his home life was nowhere near those idyllic portraits.
  In the beginning of Fatherhood: A History Of Love And Power, Augustine Sedgewick recounts the troubles that Rockwell faced at home.
  The artist complained about his wife’s drinking and her criticism, and once told one of his sons that he would kill himself if not for his boys.
  The misery endured by Rockwell kicks off Sedgewick’s wide-ranging history of fatherhood, which he calls a “succession identity crises spanning thousands of years.”
  Sedgewick’s book doesn’t offer a clear answer on what it means to be a father, but he offers a series of enlightening stories about how several famous figures have approached fatherhood.
  It’s a motley assortment of dads, ranging from Plato to Bob Dylan.
  The profiles, at times, feel disjointed, but that doesn’t make the details Sedgewick unearths about how the approach to fatherhood changed over the years any less interesting.
  The book shows how naturalist Charles Darwin’s close relationship with his sons helped shape his research on natural selection. And how Dylan rewrote his happy childhood in Hibbing, Minnesota, as he gained fame and reinvented his story to fit his image.
  “Dylan understood, arguably before anyone else, one of the defining emotional truths of rock ‘n’ roll: a perfectly nice home can sometimes be the worst kind of all,” Sedgewick writes.
  Sedgewick’s book shouldn’t be viewed as a guide for fathers or families, but it is a timely read for a point where family roles continue to evolve and be challenged. – AP

  Meanwhile, Astro Awani executive editor Zaiful Ariffin described the opportunity to report on the haj as a great trust placed upon him and his fellow media practitioners in their efforts to deliver accurate, comprehensive and heartfelt information to Malaysians.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 (Bernama) -- The final day of the 2025 HAWANA Carnival at Sunway Putra Mall ended on a lively note, as visitors took the opportunity to learn more about journalism.
  One of them, Nurimshah Muhammad Yaseen, 20, said her interest in the field, particularly in becoming a news presenter,  inspired her to attend the three-day carnival.
  “So far, I have only seen journalists on television, but this time I got the chance to experience what it’s like to report on an actual incident, the Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI) bus accident incident,  at the Bernama Radio and Media Prima booths,” she told Bernama.
  She shared that she also had the chance to audition for an acting role at the RTM booth, describing the experience as meaningful and unforgettable.
  Having recently completed his diploma in software, Nurimshah expressed hope that programmes like this would continue to be organised annually, as they help bring the public closer to the real world of journalism and media.
  Another visitor, Ismail Mohd Azlan, 49, said the carnival provided the best opportunity for the public to get to know the role of the media.
  “Usually, we only see artist performances at shopping malls, but this time, we saw mini news and radio studios brought here. It provided exposure and thus attracted the public’s interest in journalism.
  “Carnivals like this are good for bringing the public closer to journalists. Visitors can also ask directly about how to channel complaints to journalists about local issues and problems,” he said.
  Ismail, who is a technician, said that the visit to the Selangor Media booth also opened his eyes to the existence of newspapers under the Selangor government.
  He said such a carnival should continue so that the public can obtain information directly from media agencies about the products and services offered.
  The HAWANA 2025 Carnival, being held for three days since last Friday, is part of this year’s National Journalist Day (HAWANA) celebration, with the culminating ceremony held yesterday and officiated by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim at the Kuala Lumpur World Trade Centre (WTCKL).
  The HAWANA 2025 celebration, organised by the Ministry of Communications with the Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) as the implementing agency, aims to recognise the role and contribution of media practitioners in the country’s development.

MIAMI (Reuters) -Lionel Messi showed flashes of his brilliance as his Inter Miami side were held to a goalless draw by African giants Al-Ahly in the revamped Club World Cup opener.
  Fans showed up en masse for the Group A clash at the Hard Rock Stadium, home to the Miami Dolphins, but Messi could not fully deliver, his best chance coming through a last-second attempt that was deflected onto the crossbar.
  Inter Miami next face FC Porto on Thursday in Atlanta while Al-Ahly will take on Palmeiras in New York.

MIAMI (Reuters) -Although he did not score, Lionel Messi again proved his worth with Inter Miami, showing some brilliance and avoiding injury as they got off to a decent start in the Club World Cup with a goalless draw against African giants Al-Ahly from Egypt on Saturday.
  WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
  Messi draws massive crowds to stadiums, and attendance will be a key measure of the revamped Club World Cup's success or failure. On Saturday, almost 61,000 fans filled the Hard Rock Stadium, making for a festive atmosphere and giving the tournament a satisfying start.
  KEY QUOTES
  Javier Mascherano, Inter Miami coach: "We were very nervous and anxious in the first half, which is normal given the context. In the second half, we were more patient. We played all over the pitch, created chances and could have scored to win the game. But it’s a 90-minute match, and let’s not forget we struggled in that first half.
  "It’s clear that when we find Leo (Messi) in the right positions and give him good passes, we have more options and chances. In the first half, we kept trying to find him with the first ball, but they were ready for us.
  "When we were more patient, we were able to find Leo. And we all know what he can do when he finds space."  
  Jose Riveiro, Al-Ahly coach: "It was a very intense game, with nervousness and mistakes from both sides, but we controlled the scenario better in the first half, creating chances. But it's a pity we did not convert one of them.
  "In the second half, Miami were getting better and after 60, 70 minutes it could have gone in either direction. We have to make sure next game we are a little bit better.
  "We first made sure Messi was cut off from his providers, but then he appeared in those set pieces and second actions after set pieces."

MIAMI, June 15 — Lionel Messi and Inter Miami were held to a 0-0 draw by Egyptian side Al Ahly on yesterday as Fifa’s new 32-team tournament got off to a smooth start in front of 60,927 fans in Florida.
  Messi was denied a storybook stoppage-time winner when he saw his curling shot from 20 yards out tipped on to the bar by Mohamed El Shenawy as Miami piled on the pressure in the final minutes of the game.
  Al Ahly, who were cheered on by over 10,000 of their supporters, were left to rue a first-half penalty from Egypt international Trezeguet which was saved by Miami’s Argentine keeper Oscar Ustari.
  But the Egyptians also had El Shenawy to thank for another fine save in the dying seconds to keep out a header from Maxi Falcon as Miami pushed for three points in the Group A clash.
  For organisers Fifa, who have faced heavy scepticism over the necessity for the tournament, the absence of a goal was the only disappointment on a night that delivered everything else that their president Gianni Infantino had hoped for from the opening night.
  Fears of a low crowd for the opener eased as the seats in the 64,000 venue began to fill up with the stadium almost full at kick-off time.
  Thousands of fans of Al Ahly, record 12 times African Champions League winner and 45-time league champions of Egypt, arrived at Hard Rock Stadium well ahead of kick-off and made their presence felt with singing and chanting.
  The stadium, home to the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, witnessed chaotic scenes last year at the final of the Copa America between Argentina and Colombia where fans broke into the ground after long delays to enter.

  Penalty drama  
  But there was an efficient filter system set up for ticket and security checks well away from the stadium perimeter and there were no signs of any problems.
  Nor was there any indication of the controversial crackdown on illegal immigrants from US President Donald Trump’s administration having any impact on the game in the heavily Hispanic South Florida community.
  This is the first edition of the new expanded format for the tournament which features clubs from every continent and concludes with the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 13.
  Infantino has called the competition a “new era for football” bringing globalisation to the club game but critics have said it adds to an already congested calendar.
  While there were no goals to celebrate, the game was far from boring with Al Ahly enjoying the better of the first half before Miami improved significantly after the break.
  Al Ahly opened up Miami’s defence with ease in the opening minutes of the game and Emam Ashour was denied by Ustari after being put through by Trezeguet.
  Palestine international striker Wessam Abou Ali had an effort ruled out for offside in the 31st minute and then the Denmark-born forward had a fierce strike tipped over by Ustari.
  The penalty came when Telasco Segovia bundled over Zizo but Trezeguet’s spot kick was weak and parried out with the former Aston Villa forward unable to react fast enough to the rebound.
  Miami were stronger after the break with Messi going close in the 64th minute with a free-kick which grazed the post before hitting the side-netting, tricking part of the crowd into thinking he had scored.
  He nearly did in stoppage time, after a well-worked short-corner but the outstretched finger tip of El Shenawy was to deny him.

群星云集迈阿密硬石球场
世界球会杯揭幕战，迈阿密硬石球场可谓牌面、气氛拉满，国际足联（FIFA）会长因凡蒂诺、
贝克汉姆
爵士、巴乔、罗纳尔多、温格、扎切罗尼等名流、足球传奇悉数到场观战。
美中不足的是，由巴塞罗那“三老”梅西、苏亚雷斯、布斯克茨领衔的迈阿密国际，在A组首轮与埃及班霸阿尔阿里互交白卷。
双方门将12次扑救成主角
巴塞三老打满全场，但他们并不是比赛主角，双方门将一共12次扑救，其中效力迈阿密国际、下个月就将39岁的乌斯塔里共8次神扑，力挽狂澜！
比赛中，迈阿密国际占据控球优势，但阿尔阿里的进攻更流畅、犀利。前20分钟，乌斯塔里完成2次关键扑救，力保龙门不失，但球队表现不佳，马斯切拉诺一脸无奈。
梅西倒地虚惊一场
第30分钟，阿尔阿里反击单刀破门，但边裁举旗示意越位，进球无效。5分钟后，梅西遭到对方侵犯痛苦倒地，好在只是虚惊一场。
第38分钟，梅西自由球吊入禁区，阿尔阿里门将谢纳维出击化解险情。第42分钟，阿尔阿里获得点球，阿伦禁区内犯规踢倒齐佐，主裁果断吹罚点球；埃及国脚特雷泽盖操刀主罚，迈阿密门将乌斯塔里神勇发挥，将半高球扑出。
半场最后时刻，迈阿密国际发起猛攻，第45分钟，梅西劲射击中立柱后，两度直接角球似传似射，制造阿尔阿里门前混乱。上半场，阿尔阿里场面占优，梅西则主导了迈阿密国际所有威胁进攻。
易边再战，梅西不断创造威胁。第64分钟，梅西突破制造自由球，距离球门25公尺处左脚兜出弧线球击中边网。
梅西狂轰6脚无功而返
阿尔阿里队长门神谢纳维更在终场前上演“三连扑”：先后化解法法的头球、梅西禁区劲射，最后用头挡出法尔康的攻门。
梅西此役共6次射门，包含2次自由球与4次禁区外远射。除了射门，梅西还多次策动反击与换边转移，传球成功率达84%，并完成两次过人与一次回防成功，为迈阿密全场最具影响力的球员。

乌斯塔里8次扑救当选MVP
两队门将都发挥高水平，8次扑救的乌斯塔里获得本场最佳。
赛后，迈阿密主帅马斯切拉诺表示 ：“从全场看，我们是表现更好一方。我们能活著离开上半场是奇迹，但下半场我们明显优于他们，有控球也有射门。虽然没赢，但我仍对比赛表现感到满意。”

MIAMI GARDENS
:
Lionel Messi and Inter Miami were held to a 0-0 draw by Egyptian side Al Ahly today as Fifa’s new 32-team tournament got off to a smooth start in front of 60,927 fans in Florida.
Messi was denied a storybook stoppage-time winner when he saw his curling shot from 20 yards out tipped onto the bar by Mohamed El Shenawy as Miami piled on the pressure in the final minutes of the game.
Al Ahly, who were cheered on by over 10,000 of their supporters, were left to rue a first half penalty from Egypt international Trezeguet which was saved by Miami’s Argentine keeper Oscar Ustari.
But the Egyptians also had El Shenawy to thank for another fine save in the dying seconds to keep out a header from Maxi Falcon as Miami pushed for three points in the Group A clash.
For organisers Fifa, who have faced heavy scepticism over the necessity for the tournament, the absence of a goal was the only disappointment on a night that delivered everything else that their president Gianni Infantino had hoped for from the opening night.
Fears of a low crowd for the opener eased as the seats in the 64,000 venue began to fill up with the stadium almost full at kickoff time.
Thousands of fans of Al Ahly, record 12 times African Champions League winner and 45-time league champions of Egypt, arrived at Hard Rock Stadium well ahead of kickoff and made their presence felt with singing and chanting.
The stadium, home to the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, witnessed chaotic scenes last year at the final of the Copa America between Argentina and Colombia where fans broke into the ground after long delays to enter.
But there was an efficient filter system set up for ticket and security checks well away from the stadium perimeter and there were no signs of any problems.
Nor was there any indication of the controversial crackdown on illegal immigrants from US President Donald Trump’s administration having any impact on the game in the heavily Hispanic South Florida community.
This is the first edition of the new expanded format for the tournament which features clubs from every continent and concludes with the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 13.
Infantino has called the competition a “new era for football” bringing globalisation to the club game but critics have said it adds to an already congested calendar.
While there were no goals to celebrate, the game was far from boring with Al Ahly enjoying the better of the first half before Miami improved significantly after the break.
Al Ahly opened up Miami’s defence with ease in the opening minutes of the game and Emam Ashour was denied by Ustari after being put through by Trezeguet.
Palestine international striker Wessam Abou Ali had an effort ruled out for offside in the 31st minute and then the Denmark-born forward had a fierce strike tipped over by Ustari.
The penalty came when Telasco Segovia bundled over Zizo but Trezeguet’s spotkick was weak and parried out with the former Aston Villa forward unable to react fast enough to the rebound.
Miami were stronger after the break with Messi going close in the 64th minute with a freekick that grazed the post before hitting the side-netting, tricking part of the crowd into thinking he had scored.
He nearly did in stoppage-time, after a well-worked short-corner but the outstretched fingertip of El Shenawy was to deny him.
Miami face Porto in Atlanta on Friday before returning home to face Brazil’s Palmeiras on Tuesday.

SEPANG, June 15 — The first group of Malaysian haj pilgrims arrived safely at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) at 8.50 pm last night, marking the start of the second phase of repatriation operations for the 1446H/2025M pilgrimage season.
  The group of 283 pilgrims, mainly from Kedah and Selangor, departed from King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah aboard Malaysia Airlines’ AMAL flight MH8251 at 5.40 am local time.
  Their arrival was welcomed by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Religious Affairs) Datuk Dr Mohd Na’im Mokhtar, alongside Tabung Haji (TH) chairman Tan Sri Abdul Rashid Hussain and TH Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Mustakim Mohamad.
  “Alhamdulillah, this year’s haj operations have gone smoothly and we are now beginning to bring the pilgrims home safely,” said Mohd Na’im.
  He also congratulated TH for receiving the prestigious Labaytum Diamond Award, recognising the agency’s efforts to enhance service quality and haj management internationally.
  Among the key successes this year, Mohd Na’im noted, was the safe completion of wuquf, the pivotal standing at Arafah, by all Malaysian pilgrims, including 95 ailing pilgrims who were transported in 10 specially arranged buses under the Safari Wuquf programme.
  Meanwhile, Mustakim said that despite ongoing challenges such as extreme heat and limited tent space in Mina, TH continues to implement improvements aimed at enhancing pilgrims’ comfort and safety.
  These included adding extra toilet facilities and storage space during the critical Masyair phase of the haj.
  A total of 100 chartered flights operated by AMAL and Saudia Airlines are scheduled to repatriate the entire Malaysian contingent of 31,600 pilgrims, with flights beginning today and concluding on Thursday, July 10. — Bernama
  
------------------------------
JOHOR BARU, June 15 — The Johor government today asked families of Malaysian pilgrims allegedly duped in a Haj travel scam to place full trust in the authorities as investigations continue.
  Johor Islamic Affairs Committee chairman Mohd Fared Mohd Khalid said the state is ready to help resolve the case as well as educate the public to be more cautious.
  “We are saddened that such scams involving the Haj continue to happen. What’s more distressing is that the victims reportedly include elderly pilgrims and those in poor health.
  “I am closely following the case and pray for the safety of the affected pilgrims,” he said in a statement.
  He stressed that there are no shortcuts to fulfilling the Haj and advised Muslims to rely on the expertise and guidance of Tabung Haji as the official pilgrimage fund.
  Yesterday, local media reported that 47 Malaysians were allegedly scammed by a local Haj agent, believed to be a well-known religious figure.
  According to news reports, one victim’s child said her parents and aunt departed for Saudi Arabia with the agent on May 9.
  Upon arrival in Jeddah, the pilgrims were allegedly forced to walk to Mecca through dangerous routes without documents, due to Saudi Arabia’s strict enforcement against those without valid Haj visas.
  
------------------------------
JOHOR BAHRU, June 15 (Bernama) -- The Johor government has expressed disappointment over reports that Malaysian pilgrims were victims of a fraudulent haj package, and were allegedly confined and forced to take a perilous journey on foot to Makkah without proper documentation.
  State Islamic Religious Affairs Committee chairman Mohd Fared Mohd Khalid said he is closely monitoring the situation and praying for the safety of those affected.
  “We are saddened that such haj-related scams continue to occur. What is even more distressing is that the victims are elderly individuals and those with health issues,” he said in a statement today.
  He urged the families of the victim to remain patient and place their full trust in the authorities to carry out a thorough investigation.
  The state government, he added, stands ready to assist the relevant authorities in resolving such issues and educate the public to be more cautious.
  Mohd Fared stressed that there are no shortcuts in performing haj, and advised the public to rely on the expertise and advisory services of Tabung Haji.
  According to media reports yesterday, 47 Malaysian pilgrims allegedly fell victim to the scam, believed to be linked to a prominent religious figure.
  A daughter of one of the victims claimed her parents and aunt left for Saudi Arabia to perform the haj with the said agent on May 9.
  However, upon arriving in Jeddah, they were allegedly forced to travel on foot via unsafe routes without valid haj visas, fearing strict enforcement by Saudi authorities.

PUTRAJAYA, June 15 (Bernama) -- Enforcement agencies need to work more closely with the media to ensure that information on services, policies and programmes is delivered accurately and effectively to the public.
  Former Immigration Director-General Datuk Seri Mustafar Ali emphasised that such cooperation is crucial, as the media serves as a strategic partner in helping enforcement agencies convey clear and consistent messages about their initiatives and actions to the community.
  "The media and enforcement agencies are interdependent. The media plays a vital role in ensuring that every message, including those related to the enforcement and public service delivery, reaches the community comprehensively,” he said.
  Mustafar, who is also the former Director-General of the National Financial Crimes Prevention Centre (NFCC), noted that throughout his career, he has maintained close ties with the media to help raise public awareness about enforcement activities and to foster public support for these efforts.
  “This relationship is important because public backing can strengthen enforcement initiatives. When people are well-informed, they are more likely to cooperate with and support the work of enforcement agencies,” he told Bernama in conjunction with the National Journalists' Day (HAWANA) 2025 celebration.
  He said agencies such as the Immigration Department, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and NFCC should explore new innovative ways to collaborate with the media so that everything is delivered simply and effectively.
  “I believe that our media operates professionally, and equally important is for agencies to provide information clearly, promptly and in a way that is relevant to the public.
  “People today don’t have the time or interest to read lengthy texts. They want quick, concise updates on issues,” he said.
  Meanwhile, Mustafar said the media in Malaysia has been given freedom to report, but with that freedom comes the responsibility for every media practitioner to uphold ethical standards and deliver news that is factual and accurate.
  “The media must remain free, but at the same time, practitioners also have a responsibility to ensure the information they disseminate is correct. Do not let the news be misunderstood, as this can lead to misunderstandings and create negative perceptions of the country or individuals,” he said.
  The chairman of Rapid Bus Sdn. Bhd also reminded the public to be discerning when evaluating and filtering news sources, particularly on social media platforms where information spreads rapidly but is not always reliable.
  Themed “New Era Journalism: Balancing AI and Ethics”, the culmination of the HAWANA 2025 celebration took place yesterday at the World Trade Centre Kuala Lumpur (WTCKL) with the opening by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and was attended by about 1,000 local and foreign media practitioners.
  The HAWANA 2025 celebration will continue with various activities, including media sports events featuring traditional games, and a series of tours to premier polytechnics in Selangor, Perak and Johor to instil interest in the world of journalism and media in the younger generation.
  HAWANA, organised by the Ministry of Communications with the Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) as the implementing agency, aims to celebrate the role and contribution of media practitioners in the country’s development.

林梦河第二大桥工程。
（林梦15日讯）砂总理拿督巴丁宜阿邦佐哈里披露，砂拉越基本上已同意在林梦的班丹（Pandam）与汶莱的鲁马帕斯（Lumapas）建设新的关卡、移民及检疫大楼（CIQ），有关计划此前在我国与汶莱已在最近举行的双边会议上进行讨论。
便利人民出行 加强汶砂经贸
ADVERTISEMENT
阿邦佐哈里昨午视察林梦河第二大桥工程项目时向媒体说，这项计划不仅将加强马来西亚（即砂拉越）与汶莱之间的陆路边境安全合作与通关协调，同时能便利两国人民的出行与流动，并加强汶莱与砂拉越之间的经贸联系。
他指出，有关新的关卡、移民及检疫大楼是砂政府整体推动北砂发展的重要一环。
林梦第二大桥明年4月竣工
阿邦佐哈里透露，班丹的关卡、移民及检疫大楼建设非常有必要，尤其是在林梦河第二大桥预计将于明年4月完成。
此前，砂政府已在多个层面展开倡议，以推动在班丹及鲁马帕斯之间建设的关卡、移民及检疫大楼工作，这也涉及联邦政府与汶莱政府之间的协商。
此外，阿邦佐哈里也视察林梦博物馆，了解馆内历史文物的收藏情况。

砂总理阿邦佐哈里（左三）与其他嘉宾视察林梦河第二大桥工程进展情况。
（林梦15日讯）第二座林梦河大桥的建设预计将于明年4月完成，这项发展将推动砂拉越的旅游业与汶莱设立的砂贸易及旅游驻汶莱办事处（STATOB）目标一致。
砂总理拿督巴丁宜阿邦佐哈里昨午视察林梦河第二座大桥工程进度时向媒体指出，该座桥梁一旦投入使用，将显著缩短从林梦前往邻国汶莱边境的通行时间，进而加强两地之间的人民流动与经济往来。
ADVERTISEMENT
“我也已经获悉，有关缆索桥（cable-stayed bridge）部分预计可在今年年底完成，也就是在接下来6个月内完成。如果一切顺利在12月完工，它有望在2026年4月投入使用。”
“目前，砂拉越与汶莱之间已建立良好的贸易关系。随着砂贸易及旅游驻汶莱办事处在汶莱设立办事处，加上这座桥的建成，它将成为马来西亚与汶莱两国政府合作关系的重要象征。”
他强调，这项基础设施项目不仅对提升林梦的交通连通性具有重要意义，更象征着砂拉越与汶莱在多个领域，尤其是能源与经济发展方面的合作进入新阶段。
“我们已与汶莱方面达成共识，未来将在更多领域共同推动区域发展，特别是在砂拉越和汶莱之间的合作项目上。”
阿邦佐哈里重申，砂政府将继续推动区域互联互通，打造更强大和可持续的经济体系，为人民带来更直接的利益。
他表示，林梦第二座大桥建成后，将为北砂区旅游业注入新动力，进一步促进马汶两国以自然生态为基础的旅游发展。

林梦河第二大桥工程。
（林梦15日讯）砂总理拿督巴丁宜阿邦佐哈里表示，汶莱国斯里巴加湾市（Bandar Seri Begawan）有望成为游客的主要入境点。透过林梦河第二座大桥工程，从汶莱国斯里巴加湾市前往砂拉越林梦仅需约30分钟车程，为游客提供一段短暂而便捷的跨境旅程。
“除了桥梁，我们也已建设从林梦前往布达山（Gunung Buda）的道路。布达山本身就是姆禄山国家公园（Gunung Mulu National Park）的一部分，游客可沿着这条路线继续前往姆禄山，探索世界自然遗产的魅力。”

他补充，从砂拉越美里（Miri）通往马鲁帝（Marudi）的道路建设也在推进中。有关桥梁工程已完成，并将继续延伸至马鲁帝衔接弄特拉旺（Long Terawan），最终与通往布达山的道路接通，形成一条贯穿的交通网络。
“这项综合性的交通基础设施发展，将带来更高的交通流动性（easy mobility），让游客能更轻松的穿梭于多个自然景点之间，同时将成为推动砂拉越与汶莱发展生态旅游的重要支撑。”
阿邦佐哈里昨午视察林梦河第二座大桥工程进度时向媒体强调，这一系列项目不仅便利游客，也将为本地社区带来经济效益，推动区域整体可持续发展。
另一方面，阿邦佐哈里提及林梦博物馆时，建议加入更多有关林梦和老越发展历史的视频。
他补充，林梦博物馆承载着自古至今的重要历史，并建议增加关于老越和林梦发展的影片内容。

（古晋15日讯）砂总理拿督巴丁宜
阿邦佐哈里
宣布，原则上批准
甘榜西里益与甘榜巴洛
河滨公园
计划，借此打造古晋河滨公园延伸至新尧湾的
水上旅游产品
。
他今日中午在西里益赛船盛会闭幕礼上致词时说，甘榜西里益与甘榜巴洛河滨公园计划各耗资2000万令吉，这将推动河滨休闲及旅游活动。
ADVERTISEMENT
“我们希望人们能更方便垂钓、观赏赛船盛会，同时吸引游客到来，就如新尧湾河滨公园一样，新尧湾也成为每逢周末的热闹景点。”
阿邦佐哈里说，一旦甘榜西里益与甘榜巴洛河滨公园建成，将衔接古晋河滨公园与砂督，让游客可以通过水路游览河畔美景，甚至可打造成旅游产品，让游客在甘榜西里益或甘榜巴洛河滨公园享用海鲜后，再乘船前往新尧湾，参观当地白人拉惹历史遗迹。
他强调，尽管本身转换选区（从砂督转为日廊选区），惟甘榜西里益与甘榜巴洛始终在他心中，因为他首次担任人民代议士，就是在这些地区服务，并见证西里益赛船盛会的发展。
“甘榜西里益及甘榜巴洛早前属于已故拿督阿玛沈庆鸿的选区范围，如今其儿子（拿督阿玛沈桂贤）担任砂副总理，当地发展面貌也与以往不同。”
阿邦佐哈里抵达甘榜西里益时，获得居民们热烈迎接。
他说，当初极力争取兴建马当马丽哈通往西里益道路，如今马当马丽哈发展迅速，已如同一个新市镇，其发展速度让他惊讶。
他表示，人民唯有团结一致，砂才能持续发展。他担任总理8年以来，砂一向安宁和谐，正因如此，砂才能持续前进，收入也持续增加。

代表团前往泰国的哥乐镇火车站视察。（脸书图）
（哥打峇鲁15日讯）掌管丹州旅游、文化、艺术与遗产委员会的州行政议员拿督卡玛鲁丁表示，将全力支持加快修复哥乐河至兰斗班让铁路线项目的落实。
他说，丹州政府乐见该项目尽快启动，并愿意全力配合，以推动旅游与经济发展。
ADVERTISEMENT
他也乐观地认为，兰斗班让将迎来更具活力的经济转型。
“立即落实
兰斗班让–双溪哥乐铁路
建设项目，将有助于完善联邦与州政府共同推动的边境城市发展计划，使其成为重要的贸易与旅游枢纽。”
泰国国家铁路局日前已对马来西亚进行了一次正式访问，以讨论并的工作。
此次访问也涉及计划建设一条将两国铁路网络连接起来的双轨铁道。
根据该局官方声明，此行是为了延续2025年5月2日于曼谷举行的泰马双边交通会议。该会议由泰国副首相兼交通部长素里亚与我国交通部长陆兆福共同主持。
在会议中，双方一致同意加快修复这条横跨两国边境的重要铁路线路。
泰国当局此次访问的主要目的是评估通过双溪哥乐铁路桥实现跨境铁路运输的基础设施准备情况。该铁路桥曾是乘客与货物运输的重要通道，但已停运超过20年。而兰斗班让至巴西马之间18.7公里长的铁路线也因洪灾受损，至今未能恢复运营。
对连接ECRL网络至关重要
双方同意，该线路的修复对于连接标准轨（轨距1.435公尺）、全长665公里的ECRL铁路网络至关重要。

根据进度，截至5月，ECRL项目已完成83.38％，并预计将分阶段投入使用。
第一阶段：哥打峇鲁至鹅唛预计于2027年第一季度启用；
第二阶段：鹅唛至巴生港口预计在2027年第四季度投入运营。
此外，我国交通部透露，正在研究将ECRL线路从哥打峇鲁延伸至兰斗班让的可行性，全长约30.5公里，以便更好地接轨马泰现有铁路网络。
代表团也前往泰国的哥乐镇火车站视察，发现泰国方面的铁路基础设施已升级，准备重新启动跨境运输服务。
目前，从合艾总站（Hatyai Junction）至双溪哥乐全长216公里的铁路为单轨线路，采用BS100钢轨和单块式混凝土轨枕（monoblock），结构坚固稳定。此线路的终点为双溪哥乐铁路桥，正是泰马两国的分界点。
与此同时，泰国也在推进多个双轨铁路发展项目，主要包括：
1.佛统府（Nakhon Pathom）至春蓬府（Chumphon），长达420公里，已建成并投入使用；
2.春蓬至素叻他尼（Surat Thani）167公里、素叻他尼–合艾–宋卡（321公里）及合艾–巴东勿刹45公里的路线，目前正处于内阁审批阶段；
3.合艾–双溪哥乐线路，则正申请2025财年预算，进行可行性研究。

DEHRADUN (India), June 15 — Seven people including a toddler were killed today in India when a helicopter ferrying Hindu pilgrims from a shrine crashed in the Himalayas, officials said.

BANGKOK: The Thai Meteorological Department reported on Saturday (June 14) that the monsoon trough is currently lying across the upper North and upper Laos, while a moderate south-west monsoon continues to prevail over the Andaman Sea, Thailand, and the Gulf of Thailand.
  Isolated heavy rainfall is likely across the upper regions of the country, raising the risk of flash floods and overflows, especially in foothill and lowland areas, the department said.
  Residents are advised to exercise caution, and farmers should take preventive measures to protect crops from potential damage.
  In contrast, the southern region is expected to see reduced rainfall, with only isolated thundershowers anticipated, the department said.
  At sea, moderate winds and waves are forecast in the upper Andaman Sea and upper Gulf, with waves reaching about two metres high and exceeding two metres in thundershowers.
  In the lower Andaman Sea and lower Gulf, waves will range between one to two metres, also rising above two metres during storms.
  All vessels are urged to proceed with caution and avoid areas with thunderstorms.Meanwhile, severe tropical storm Wutip, currently in the Gulf of Tonkin, was expected to make landfall in Guangdong, China on June 14.
  The storm poses no direct threat to Thailand, but travellers are advised to check weather conditions before travelling. - The Nation/ANN

SHAH ALAM: Tasek Gelugor MP Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan has ended his days as a widower, as his marriage to Maslina Sobri was solemnised on Saturday (June 14).
  The Bersatu supreme leadership council member took to Facebook to express gratitude for the smooth wedding ceremony and appreciated the presence of guests at the simple thanksgiving event.
  "Alhamdulillah, my marriage with Maslina Sobri was completed. I would like to thank everyone who made time to attend the thanksgiving feast held this afternoon," he said.
  Wan Saiful also expressed special appreciation to Perikatan Nasional chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and  Opposition Leader Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin as well as other friends who attended and enlivened the event.
  In his post, he also apologised to friends who were not invited due to the constraints of the small-scale event.
  "I only held a small feast as a sign of gratitude. Please pray that we will always be in His blessings and guidance," he said.
  Wan Saiful's previous wife - the late Datin Alena Omar - passed away in July 2024.
  
------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 — Tasek Gelugor MP Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan married Nurul Maslina Mohd Sobri in a low-key ceremony in Kajang, Selangor yesterday.
  The Bersatu politician announced the wedding ceremony in a Facebook post.
  “Praise be to God, today marks the solemnisation of my marriage to Maslina Sobri.
  “I would like to thank everyone who took the time to attend the simple thanksgiving reception held this evening,” he wrote.
  “Please pray that we will always be blessed and guided by Him,” the 48-year-old added.
  He apologised for not being able to invite all his friends to the ceremony in Kajang, Selangor, saying it was “just a small gathering” attended only by close friends.
  He expressed appreciation to those who attended, among them Bersatu president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and party deputy Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin.

(Reuters) -High-flying Brazilian Yago Dora soared to victory over Japan's Kanoa Igarashi in the final of the Lexus Trestles Pro in Southern California on Saturday, while Hawaii's Bettylou Sakura Johnson took out her second event of surfing's 2025 world tour.
  Lower Trestles, the surfing venue for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, provided an ideal canvas for the world's best surfers to showcase their high-performance surfing, and Dora's aerial antics proved unstoppable. 
  Concentrating on the left-handers of the Lower's peak, Dora landed a dizzying array of spins and grabs as he took down event favourites Ethan Ewing of Australia in the quarterfinals and hometown hero Griffin Colapinto in the semis.
  Just seconds into the final against Igarashi, Dora stomped a giant air reverse on an overhead left, combining it with some sharp turns for a near-perfect 9.53 out of 10. 
  The 29-year-old kept with the winning formula, racking up three more excellent scores on the lefts, the best of which, an 8.37, gave him a two-wave total of 17.9 out of a possible 20.
  Igarashi, the Tokyo 2020 silver medallist, stayed in contention with some stylish and high-risk rides of his own, but could not get ahead of the Brazilian and ended with a two-wave total of 16.07.
  Lower Trestles has for the past four years hosted the World Surf League's one-day winner-takes-all Final's day for the top five surfers at the end of the regular season. It was moved to event number eight on this year's tour, giving Dora the chance to surf Trestles in competition for the first time.
  "I've been watching the Finals from home the last few years and just dreaming about this little left here. I finally had the opportunity, and to come out with the win is very special," said Dora, who also won in Portugal this year.
  Johnson, on the women's side, took a different approach to Dora, focusing on the long right-handers on the cobblestone point and getting her best scores throughout the final day of competition with sharp carves and critical turns in the lip. 
  The 20-year-old from Oahu's North Shore took down former world and Olympic champion Caroline Marks in their quarterfinal and Californian Sawyer Lindblad in the semis to meet Australia's Molly Picklum in the final.
  Johnson started with an excellent 8 for two huge turns, improving to a 9 for a series of carves and a big vertical re-entry. With the waves taking a breather late in the final, Johnson's 17 point total was too much for Picklum, who finished with a two-wave score of 14.23. 
  "I came up top today, and I'm super grateful. We got to surf amazing waves today, so I'm super happy to bring it home," said Johnson, who moves up to number 4 in the world rankings.
  The tour next heads to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil later this month for stop number nine of 11. The top five men and women will then compete for the world title in Fiji.

自从进入联邦政府后，行动党已从长年在野的反对党，转型为执政联盟中的重要一员。然而岁月转辗数年，小部分行动党领袖迄今在许多课题上，仍不时针对马华发表批评，甚至将其作为政治攻击的主要对象，形成主流执政党在“监督”非主流政党的独特现象。
这种现象背后，反映的不只是政党之间的对立，更是一种尚未完成的心理与角色转型。
ADVERTISEMENT
行动党在过去多年反对国阵时期，经常将马华定位为“附庸巫统“、“出卖华社”的代名词，让它成功地凝聚了广泛华人选票。在2008年与2013年全国大选中，“骂马华”几乎成为行动党动员选民的标志手法，也令其在华社中取得压倒性优势，更让它在2018年大选夺下执政权，成为执政党的基石。
然而时至今日，行动党已与巫统共组政府，成为执政主体之一。但是在很多课题上，批评马华对部分行动党领袖来说，仍是一种“低风险”的政治操作，绝对可以被华裔选民接受。
经过数届大选的惨败后，马华在国会仅剩数席，实权不大，几乎无法构成实质挑战。因此行动党以马华作为批评对象，不仅可延续过去对马华的否定，也能在执政压力下，转移公众对政策进展缓慢的注意力。
然而，这样的做法长期而言不具建设性，反而可能让民众认为行动党仍自我封锁在过去的批判斗争框架中，仍未真正迈入更高层次的政治论述。
尽管马华今日政治势力式微，但在象征层面，它仍具有“镜子效应”。行动党昔日批评马华在政府内却无实权，未能替华社争取应有利益；如今行动党本身在团结政府里，也须与巫统协调政策，在部分敏感议题上甚至需作出某种程度的妥协，这与当年批评马华的处境颇为相似。
因此，持续批评马华，某种程度上或许是行动党希望自我区隔、向支持者重申“我们不一样”的政治讯息。但这种强调，反而也可能暴露了内部对“是否变成另一个马华”的焦虑。
在执政阵营的政党最终必须以政策说服选民，而非依赖昔日情绪操作，因此如今的行动党领袖应将更多注意力投入于经济、教育、公平治理与制度改革上，建立属于自己的治理叙事与政策成绩。若继续将马华作为政治话题，只会让人觉得缺乏新方向。
无可否认，大家希望看到的是行动党作为政府一员的表现，而非一再重提过去的对手。
马来西亚政治正处于重组阶段，跨族群合作成为新常态，行动党若希望扩大支持面、赢得更广泛的社会认同，必须学会放下对马华的执念，从反对角色走向建设国家的真正主流角色。
唯有如此，才能真正走出在野阴影，迈向成熟执政的新格局。

Is losing weight still worthwhile after the age of 40?
  A large Finnish study published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open dispels any doubts.
  It claims that losing weight in your 40s drastically reduces the risk of chronic diseases and prolongs life, even without extreme dieting.
  To reach these conclusions, researchers at the University of Helsinki compiled data from three major studies conducted among British and Finnish populations.
  In total, more than 23,000 people were followed for 22 to 35 years, an exceptionally long period that allows for the observation of real health impacts.
  It appears that adults who lost weight in their 40s reduced their risk of chronic disease by 48% and their risk of death by 19%.
  These benefits go far beyond the prevention of diabetes, which has already been established by other research.
  Losing weight at this age also reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, cancer, asthma and lung disease.
  These protective effects persist even when researchers exclude diabetes from their calculations.
  Importantly, this study was conducted at a time when bariatric surgery and weight-loss drugs were relatively rare.
  Participants therefore achieved these results solely through diet and exercise, methods that are accessible to everyone.
  “The benefits of lifestyle-based weight management are widely discussed even though studies have found it surprisingly difficult to demonstrate health benefits beyond the prevention of diabetes,” study co-author, Professor Timo Strandberg said in a news release.
  However, maintaining weight loss over the long term remains a major challenge, as the figures from this study illustrate.
  Indeed, only 96 British participants and 188 Finnish participants managed to lose weight and keep it off, compared to more than 1,200 who remained overweight throughout the study period.
  This study also highlights a little-known aspect of weight loss.
  Contrary to popular belief, the most significant benefits are neither immediate nor spectacular.
  The most significant effects can take decades to become apparent, which explains why such a long follow-up period was needed to identify them.
  The message is therefore clear for anyone who’s overweight in their 40s: while maintaining a healthy weight throughout life remains the ideal, it’s never too late to start taking action.
  In fact, even modest but sustainable weight loss can pay big dividends in the long run and add precious years to your life. – AFP Relaxnews

“Blind box” toymaker Pop Mart, which has seen frenzied sales worldwide for products related to its ugly-cute Labubu character, opened its first jewellery store in Shanghai on June 13.
  The jewellery concept store, called Popop, sells accessories adorned with Pop Mart’s top-selling characters, including Labubu, Molly and Skullpanda.
  While Chinese consumption remains subdued in the face of a prolonged property downturn and sluggish economy, Pop Mart’s affordable and adorable toys have remained in high demand both at home and abroad, driving its share price up more than 200 per cent so far in 2025.
  People visit a newly opened Popop store, the Chinese toy maker Pop Mart's premium jewellery brand, in Shanghai, China.
  Investor Zhang Zhanming, 34, who owns Pop Mart stocks worth 100 million yuan (RM59.175mil), flew from his base in the south-western Chinese city of Chongqing for the opening to check out the new store type and decide whether to increase his shareholding in the company.
  “I believe that the pricing and target audience for this brand are particularly well-suited, and I am confident that Pop Mart could potentially become China’s version of Disney,” Mr Zhang said, predicting that the company’s market cap could double from its current US$45.6 billion (RM193.6bil) valuation.

  Along with some Disney characters and others related to anime, comics and popular video games, Pop Mart’s characters are seen as fulfilling what has been called “emotional consumption”, which sees young consumers spend on affordable luxuries that bring joy into their lives.
  Ms Fang Ke, 35, who has a birthday coming up in June, decided to treat herself to a 699 yuan Labubu bracelet at the opening. — Reuters

CUPERTINO:  At its annual developer conference WWDC, Apple has given us another preview of software innovations coming to the iPhone, Mac and other devices from the company.
  These include many AI features, but the first change you're likely to notice is the new design in the operating systems. Since the launch of the iPhone in 2007, there have essentially only been two design directions for the software.
  Initially, Apple sought to mimic real-world objects, such as wooden bookshelves for the Books app, to help users understand the concept of multitouch screens. With iOS 7 in 2013, a starkly minimalist alternative was introduced, featuring icons made of just a few lines.
  In what Apple is marketing as 'Liquid Glass', software will have more glass-like transparent buttons, apps and other text elements that appear to float above what's behind it.
  This minimalism has been mixed with more colour in recent years, but the two-dimensional principle remained. Now, a new design language called Liquid Glass is being introduced.
  Transparent elements, which appear to float above other content, are intended to evoke the look of flowing glass.
  1. A new glassy design language: For the first time, Apple is introducing a unified design language across its entire product range, including the Apple Watch and the Apple TV streaming box.
  Additionally, all operating systems will now feature a year in their name instead of their own version numbers. For example, instead of iOS 19 following iOS 18, the next version will be called iOS 26 or iPadOS 26, with the "26" referring to the upcoming year.
  2. Fewer buttons in the camera app: The camera app, one of the most frequently used iPhone apps, has also been simplified at first glance, when you only see the shutter button and another option to switch between photo and video.
  Additional settings and functions are now hidden behind small icons or appear only when swiping across the display.
  Future Apple software updates will all be tied to the coming year in their name, meaning this year's software updates will be iOS 26, iPadOS 26, visionOS 26 and watchOS 26.
  At the same time, some settings can now be accessed more quickly than before. The Photos app is also being revamped and a toggle will allow users to quickly switch between the library and various collections.
  3. Improved call features: The iPhone is gaining two useful features previously known from Google’s Android system. For unknown phone numbers, users can have the software ask what the call is about and decide whether to answer based on the transcribed response.
  Additionally, during hold times, the phone can monitor when a human operator picks up and then connect the call.
  4. Built-in interpreter: Apple is also significantly expanding its live translation features. During video calls, translations will appear as subtitles, naturally in a Liquid Glass overlay.
  For voice calls, the software will act as an interpreter. In the Music app, song lyrics can also be translated.
  Apple presents the new look of the user interface of its devices at the developer conference WWDC. The new design is called 'Liquid Glass' and is made to look like floating transparent pieces of glass.
  5. New gesture for Apple Watch: Notifications displayed on the Apple Watch currently remain on the screen for several seconds unless you dismiss them or interact with them in some other way. In future, you'll be able to shake them away without tapping, using a quick wrist flick away from you. This gesture can also be used to reject incoming calls.
  6. Maps app with memory: Apple’s Maps app will soon be able to remember restaurants or shops users have visited, making it easier to find them again later. The iPhone will also remember preferred routes to frequently visited locations and suggest them.
  The information is protected with end-to-end encryption, ensuring that even Apple cannot access it, the company emphasised.
  7. iPad gets a massive Mac feature: Many iPad users have long complained about how hard it is to work with multiple apps, while on Mac computers, arranging windows side by side is simple. Apple is now promising improvements and is even bringing the trademark traffic light buttons to iPad.
  Users now get enhanced options for switching between programme windows and, for the first time, a menu bar. This makes the iPad suitable for more use cases that previously required a Mac computer.
  8. Karaoke on the TV: Apple is turning its Apple TV streaming box into a kind of karaoke machine. In conjunction with Apple’s Music app on the box, the iPhone will act as your microphone, with the voice being transmitted through the TV. Others can also join in with their iPhones.
  9. Time running out for Intel Macs: In recent years, Apple has transitioned its Mac models to chips developed in-house. The new macOS 26 Tahoe will be the last version to run on Mac computers with previously used Intel processors. However, they will continue to receive security updates for three more years.
  10. Virtual widgets in real spaces: Among the innovations for Apple’s Vision Pro headset is the ability to place widgets, such as a clock, photo frame, calendar or music controls, in fixed locations. When the headset is worn in the same room, the digital objects will reappear in the same spots.
  Apple is also making the Vision Pro more suitable for business use. It will be easier to share the headset among different employees. Additionally, multiple users can collaborate on a virtual object, such as a car or a piece of furniture.
  The 3D avatar Persona, which represents users in others’ fields of view, is being significantly improved. The Vision Pro will also support external controllers, such as those for Sony’s VR headset, which is expected to enhance the experience of immersive gaming.
  Useful small updates: As always, there are various minor improvements that didn’t make it into the hour-and-a-half keynote at the developer conference. For instance, the camera will now notify users when the lens needs cleaning.
  The alarm clock will allow users to adjust the snooze duration, which has so far been fixed at nine minutes. Additionally, Apple’s password app will now display previous passwords. – dpa

GLENDALE, California: Almost a year ago, Filipino-American Art Samontina traveled back to his homeland to bury his six-year-old son Jeremiah who had suddenly died of pneumonia.
  The death of his youngest son in Ozamiz City thousands of kilometers away came as a huge blow to the 54-year-old teacher and basketball coach of Glendale High School (GHS) in this city, at a time when the Nitros, the school’s basketball team, was recording a winning season.
  “I thought about quitting! It was just too hard,” Samontina.
  But this diverse city of mostly Armenian-Americans who in 1983 elected George Deukmejian as the first and only California governor of Armenian roots, rallied around Samontina and embraced him in his grief as if he was part of them.
  “We just wanted him to forget about basketball for a while so that he can deal with his grief,” Tadeh Mardirosian, the athletic director of GHS who hired Samontina in 2022, told this reporter.
  “Art is such a consummate professional that he brings this whole package of winning, nurturing families and promoting friendships,” Mardirosian added.
  "But obviously, we are also making contingencies where if something like that happens, this is what we will do," Torre said.
  “Art is a coach, a teacher, a role model, and a mentor for so many children and their families in our community,” said Victoria Lanier, a parent who organised a GoFundMe campaign for his son’s funeral expenses.
  “He has made incredible sacrifices and dedicated himself to create opportunities for the players that have grown up under his supervision.” Lanier added.
  One who stepped up to make one huge sacrifice was Jacob, his 18-year-old son from his first marriage. The young Samontina played basketball at Burroughs, a rival high school, when he decided to play for his father in his senior year.
  “It was a no-brainer for me. When my brother died, I knew I had to be with Dad, leave my friends behind and play with my Dad to help him heal,” Jacob said as he took a break from their weekly scrimmage last Saturday.
  For a year, father and son used basketball as a coping mechanism and therapy to deal with their loss.
  “It was a good feeling with Jacob playing under me,” Samontina said.
  Like any father, Samontina had big plans for his dear departed Jeremiah, noting that his son was about his age when he arrived first in America in 1979 as the youngest of three siblings who immigrated from Cebu City.
  But his death on June 25, 2024, turned his world upside down and made him more determined to bring his new family over from the Philippines.
  Samontina has hired an immigration lawyer so that Venus, his fiancée in Ozamis City and mother of Jeremiah and their daughters Ja-Ja, 16, and Jehiah, 8, will finally join him with Jacob and Jasmine, 20, his daughter from his first marriage which ended in divorce.
  Asked by this reporter if he is worried at all about President Donald Trump’s plan of ending “chain migration,” the derogatory word used by Trump about family reunification, Samontina said: “I’m a US citizen. I don’t worry about that at all.”
  But always the fearmonger, Trump fanned the flames of anxiety and apprehension in the hearts of many immigrants with pending fiancée visa petitions of their loved ones—which brings spouses and minor children to the United States—like the one being used by Samontina.
  Trump is widely criticised for trying to end the same immigration pathway that his wife Melania used to benefit her family. In her case, she petitioned for her father Victor and mother Amalija from Slovenia to become American citizens on Aug. 19, 2018 when her husband was president.
  Time will tell whether Samontina’s dream of reuniting with his beloved Venus, Ja-Ja and Jehiah and will come into fruition.
  Samontina’s journey to his current perch in high school basketball here started when he became an assistant coach in the 1990s at San Bernardino Valley College, a small college near the Mojave desert.
  “I cleaned the floors. I did all the dirty work” said Samontina who credits his father Victorio, a retired accountant, and his mother Inocencia, a retired registered nurse, for his work ethic and dedication.
  “My parents really brought their Filipino culture to their new country. And I was all the better for it,” Samontina said.
  He got his big break when he was picked from a dozen coaches in Los Angeles to coach the GHS Nitros basketball team.
  Last Wednesday, Samontina was seen smiling with pride when he witnessed his son Jacob graduate from high school at GHS.
  “I’m also looking forward to meeting my new family. I’ve been FaceTiming with them,” said Jacob, who will be attending California State University of Long Beach, this fall with an eye to play more basketball.
  “I love playing basketball. I dream about it all the time,” he said.
  But Jacob is not the only one benefiting from fatherly love these days.
  “He is more than a father to them,” added Mardirosian, the athletic director.
  “He adopted these student athletes, every single one of them, mentoring them not only about basketball, but more importantly, about life,” he added. - Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN

Valet Technology Eyes 1Q 2026 ACE Market Listing To Advance Cyber, Identity Security
By Nurul Hanis Izmir
PUTRAJAYA, June 15 (Bernama) -- Valet Technology Sdn Bhd is gearing up for an initial public offering (IPO) on Bursa Malaysia’s ACE Market in the first quarter of 2026 as the company ramps up its expansion into cyber and identity security solutions.
Chief executive officer Puan Sri Rayana Abdul Rahman said the planned listing will support the company’s ambitions to grow beyond Malaysia and strengthen its research and development (R&D) capabilities.
“We are on track for an IPO early next year. While capital is one reason, this move is about laying a stronger foundation for our identity security and R&D pipeline,” she told Bernama.
Established in 1995 as a provider of traditional human-based security services, Valet Technology has evolved into a homegrown tech player with a 200-strong workforce and a network of more than 1,000 system integrators (SIs) nationwide.
Rayana said the company started with conventional security but saw the potential in growing together with smaller entrepreneurs. Today, its SIs carry the products across the country, and Valet Technology supports them with training and tools.
She said the company currently supports key government clients, including the Immigration Department and various ministries — Transport, Home Affairs, Higher Education and Health — largely through its SI partners.
Notably, Valet Technology, through its SIs, supplies around 200 boom gates at the CIQ complex and Tuas (second link) for pedestrian and public transport.
“We assist our SIs throughout the tender process and back them up with technical expertise and product know-how,” she said, adding that the firm’s revenue now stands at about RM25 million, with expectations for a stronger performance following the IPO.
Diversification into Cybersecurity
Best known for its VT Series sliding gate motors, Valet Technology has expanded into digital and cyber security, a move that includes the rollout of Valet Shield, an AI-powered scam call detection system developed with its US-based partners.
The firm is currently engaging with Oman’s Transport and Technology Ministry, as well as state telco Omantel under the ITHCA Group, to implement the technology in the Middle East.
“Valet Shield is built on machine learning and relies on feedback from telcos to enhance scam call prevention. Oman offers a strategic position, they are neutral and well-connected to the US, Europe, and Africa,” she said.
The company is also eyeing potential collaborations in Indonesia and within the African continent. Closer to home, Valet Technology is keen to work with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) to localise the solution.
Strengthening ESG, Talent and Governance
In preparation for its public listing, Valet Technology is sharpening its corporate governance and aligning its operations with environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmarks.
“We are already compliant with SIRIM and CIDB standards, and we work closely with our advisors to meet all ESG and listing requirements,” Rayana said.
Beyond business growth, the company has also secured a Skills Development Department license to offer TVET-level training in electronics via its in-house academy.
“Our SIs undergo structured training before they represent our products. This initiative will now expand into formal skills development. We want to help shape a new generation of skilled Malaysians who can work globally,” she said.
Future Outlook and Industry Call
Rayana believes the convergence of physical and digital security will shape the future of Malaysia’s security industry and the region, and that proactive engagement between the government and private sector is essential.
“Digital risks are evolving fast, and the threat landscape is constantly shifting. We need strong public-private collaboration to keep pace.”
She also urged policymakers to accelerate the development of cyber-related regulations, noting that outdated policies often slow industry progress.
“We’re seeing a global race in this area, and Malaysia cannot afford to lag. Regulatory agility is key,” she said.
She added that Valet Technology’s upcoming expansion into identity security will be anchored by a new division in Cyberjaya, positioning the company for its next phase of growth.

雪隆德教会紫芳阁特大决定于6月28日再度召开特大、7月27日改选理事会。（林明辉摄）
（吉隆坡15日讯）由雪隆德教会紫芳阁阁员号召的特别阁员大会今日如期举行，大会决定于6月28日（星期六）再度召开特大、7月27日（星期日）改选理事会。
尽管先后经历原任理事会警告采取法律行动对付及阁所大门被上锁，今天的特大依然如期召开，并通过多项议案。

大会议长黄耀辉宣布，今天出席特大的阁员有72人，达到章程规定的法定人数。

大会通过的议案包括再次确认数件事项，即解散本届理事会、理事会改选、开除许嵄智等14人的阁员资格及选举委员会人选。
同时，大会也委任陈炳锟出任大会副议长，并确认下次特大和改选日期。
由于原任理事会阁长拿督许嵄智昨日指已取得庭令，禁止今天召开615特大暨选举，否则将被视为藐视法庭，黄耀辉直言已知将被采取法律行动，但他毫不畏惧。
他说，采取法律行动是对方的权力，而他也会上庭继续捍卫自己和紫芳阁的权力。
“面对现在的局势，阁员们必须有坚定的立场，清楚知道自己为何要出席大会，一切都是为了维护社团的利益和尊严。如今处于风波期间，希望大家坚持住，会过去的。”
他希望下次的大会能获得更多阁员出席，若阁员踊跃参与，就可向法官证明阁员们非常关心紫芳阁，而相关纠纷可以内部解决，并非以大家不同意的其他管道处理。
“无论如何，我始终希望这次的风波可以和谐解决，让我们透过大会好好作出决定，在阁员之间妥善处理此事。”
阁员陈志聪强调，阁员拥有发起召开阁员大会的权力，因此今天的特大是合法、合理、合情的，欢迎自称仍具备理事会阁长权力的人出席大会。
阁员黄保杰呼吁阁员们团结一致，紫芳阁是个大家庭，希望大家不要互相针对；若阁员们有任何意见，欢迎提出来，大家设法解决问题。
黄耀辉：阁长须出面清楚交代
另外，黄耀辉在大会结束后受询时回应，他与今天出席的阁员都没看过许嵄智所谓的禁止召开615特大暨选举庭令，若真有此庭令，对方一定要交出来。
他强调，自己没有涉及原任理事会与“重组理事会”的司法纠纷，自己早于紫芳阁2023年改选前已受委担任大会议长，而今天的特大是由阁员发起召开。
“对我来说，紫芳阁的纠纷不该在法庭定夺，而是交给阁员在大会上做决定，毕竟法庭程序与社团不同，而根据章程，阁员大会是拥有最高决策权。”

他说，身为大会议长，自己必须保持中立的立场，不能只听任何一方的片面之词；如果有人认为大会不合法，更应该出席反对，作为民主的社团，若有足够人数反对，大家都必须尊重。
“其实阁员提出问题，阁长就必须面对，不能一再逃避；无论是地契、账目或其他疑问，必须对阁员清楚交代。”
他直言对此次风波感到失望和伤心，原本好好的社团，有纠纷就心平气和地沟通、解决，而并非将风波升级。
“我认为许嵄智等人应该出席大会，并号召支持他们的阁员一起来，而不是叫阁员别出席；若他们真的有什么委屈，不妨在大会上提出来，让阁员们定夺。”

许嵄智：只要出示阁所闭路电视画面，就知道是谁上锁、贴信函。（档案照）
（八打灵再也15日讯）雪隆德教会
紫芳阁
原任理事会拿督
许嵄智
挑战“重组理事会”出示闭路电视画面，以找出今早阁所大门被上锁事件的
始作俑者
。
雪隆德教会紫芳阁今天召开特别阁员大会，不料一早有人发现阁所大门被上锁，并张贴了由许嵄智发出的“严禁召开615特大暨选举”警告信，引起阁员不满，报警处理。
ADVERTISEMENT
许嵄智接受《星洲日报》电访时形容事件为自导自演、栽赃嫁祸，直指有人以卑鄙的行为演了一出猴子把戏，他就当作娱乐大众。
“阁所有安装闭路电视，只要出示拍摄到的画面，就知道是谁上锁、贴信函。我们已经取得法庭禁令，根本没必要做这种下三滥的事，我相信清者自清，谣言止于智者。”
对于特大以阁员号召为名如期举行，许嵄智认为有人以自欺欺人的方式来规避法庭禁令，这是非常要不得的行为，让他感到痛心和失望。
“直到昨天，我们还在释放善意，希望大家为了紫芳阁着想，坐下来好好谈，但今天他们依然无视庭令、一意孤行……我不懂说什么好，也不想批评任何人。”
他重申，庭令是从法官宣读裁决当下即时生效，而纸质庭令需要时间发出，但任何人都不能以没见过白纸黑字庭令为由，拒绝遵从庭令。
“接下来，我们会从藐视法庭角度向当事人追究责任，同时寻求法庭裁决5月25日的常年大会和今天的特大皆不合法，并向法庭申请禁止6月28日的特大及7月27日的改选。”
此外，许嵄智质疑，今日特大的出席者是否全是会员？虽然大会议长黄耀辉声称出席的阁员有72人，但他看了现场照片后表示怀疑，因此要求对方提供出席者名单。
“还有，为何今天的大会不直接推选新届理事会，反而另择日期再开特大和改选？有这个必要吗？这样做岂不是浪费阁员的时间？”
他强调，特大并非随时随地皆可召开，根据章程，需先发出正式通告，注明议程、召集人等，并且需有至少14天的通知期才有效。
对于黄耀辉及部分阁员促请原任理事会成员出席接下来召开的特大、进行当面对话，许嵄智称，必须先确定特大的合法性，同时劝请对方不要反客为主。
“只要是在恰当的场合、时间以及人身安全受到保障之下，我们随时欢迎对话。”

中国迪斯尼陷入私联争议，演职人员私联致公平体验蒙尘。（示意图）
（上海15日综合电）中国
迪士尼
乐园近日爆出“私联”争议，童话照进现实，还是饭圈文化入侵公共空间？
综合中媒报道，近期有博主在社交平台爆料，称部分游客通过非公开渠道与扮演卡通角色的演职人员（俗称“内胆”）建立私下联系，而他本人也是“受益人”之一。
ADVERTISEMENT
事件曝光后，引发网民对互动边界模糊、角色纯粹性被破坏、粉丝文化异化等问题的热议。
博主爆料，只要“成功私联”，即可绕过正常排队与互动规则，与“内胆”建立熟人关系，从而获得优待。（微博截图）
据该博主透露，只要“成功私联”，即可绕过正常排队与互动规则，与“内胆”建立熟人关系，从而获得优待，如专属暗号、互动加戏、优先互动等“特供待遇”。
而作为回报，部分他们会向“内胆”提供额外金钱、共进餐饮甚至赠送礼物。
此类行为表面看似“情谊往来”，实则严重破坏迪士尼“人人平等拥抱童话”的初衷。
不少网民指出，迪士尼的核心魅力在于角色的“非现实性”与沉浸式体验。一旦意识到玩偶背后是具体个体，幻想就被打破。
“互动时想到角色是某个真人，魔法感会瞬间消失。”
更现实的问题在于公平感受缺失。普通游客排队两小时只换来一次机械挥手，而“熟客”却能获得更深层次的眼神交流和肢体互动。
有网民将这种现象形容为“主题乐园版追星”。粉丝将对角色的情感转移到演职人员本人，进而寻求私下接触；而“内胆”则在部分游客眼中被异化为可“攻略”的资源。
对此，有博主讽刺道：“说白了，就是认识打菜阿姨可以多一勺，不抖勺。”
尽管迪士尼早有明文规定，禁止演职人员与游客私下联系，不得泄露排班或提供个性化服务，但由于互动场景隐蔽、员工流动性大，以及“非语言暗号”难以监管，执行上面临不小挑战。
也有声音呼吁社会应更客观看待此事。在高温、重压和有限薪酬的工作环境下，扮演玩偶的演职人员长期承受身体和心理双重负担，某种程度上，“私联”成为他们的情感出口。然而，这并不能成为逾越职业底线的理由。
要守护童话世界的纯粹性，就必须捍卫规则的公平性。
有专家建议，管理层可考虑引入匿名举报机制，加强岗位轮换，避免因长期固定岗位而滋生“人情关系”；同时引导游客回归对角色本身的喜爱，减少对“皮下真人”的关注。
在消费与情感交织的当代主题乐园中，如何抵御饭圈逻辑渗透，守住童话的边界，已成为管理者必须直面的新课题。
目前迪士尼尚未官方回应，但争议已冲击其“平等造梦”的品牌形象。

日本佳子公主日前搭乘巴西国内线班机，熟睡画面遭偷拍上传社媒，引发日本网友不满。（照片取自平台X@natsuki_aoi123）
（东京15日综合电）日媒《女性SEVEN PLUS》报道，号称“日本最美公主”的
佳子公主
，为庆祝日巴建交130周年展开为期10天的国际亲善之旅，不过出访第5天在当地搭乘飞机时熟睡画面遭乘客
偷拍
，影片在社媒上迅速疯传，引发日本网友不满。
为了庆祝日本与巴西建交130周年，佳子5日出访巴西，预计10天内走访8座城市，她甜美的外表也被外媒誉为“东洋黛安娜”。
ADVERTISEMENT
佳子出访第5天造访圣保罗的日本移民资料馆与文化体育协会，欣赏和太鼓演出后，搭乘国内班机自坎皮纳斯飞往马托格罗索的格兰德营，行程紧凑。由于当地部分航线仅设有经济舱，她与一般乘客同机，仅由随扈人员坐在附近维安。
一名皇室记者指出，当时佳子公主身穿简洁优雅的便装，坐在靠窗的前排座位上，看来相当疲惫，随后闭眼靠着窗边休息，却遭另一名乘客偷偷拍摄。画面上可见她在未察觉的情况下入睡。
影片曝光后，虽有外媒称她“睡脸如洋娃娃”，此举却在日本社媒上引起强烈反弹。许多网友纷纷批评，“竟放任国家外宾被偷拍，巴西政府在想什么？”、“宫内厅的维安太松懈”、“佳子公主真的太可怜了。”
另外，舆论关注佳子可能过劳。报道说，她此行10日内预定马不停蹄巡访8座城市。根据宫内厅纪录，佳子去年共承担134项公务，不少人担忧这样的高强度安排恐对其身心造成负担。

多付款项的顾客。（取自8视界新闻网）
（新加坡15日讯）男子到狮城一家粥店用餐后，
扫码付款
时把5.40元（新币，下同；约令吉）误付成540元（约令吉），店家发现后急寻顾客
退钱
。
《8视界新闻网》报道，当地一家粥店于本月10日傍晚在脸书发文透露，这名顾客当天下午2时到新加坡西城购物商场的分店用餐，扫码付款时出错。
ADVERTISEMENT
店员一发现问题，立刻在商场内寻找男子，但未能找到他，所幸监控器拍到这名男子，店家随后发布他的侧脸照片，希望公众协助寻找这名顾客。
业者陈女士受访时说，他们至今尚未找到这名顾客。
她透露，当时店员忙着协助其他顾客，且扫码付款的款项往往会延迟显示，因此当时未能及时察觉异常。他们事后通过翻查店内监控器录像，才确认顾客已经离开。
陈女士说，他们当天下午4时左右看男子仍未返回，便致电银行询问是否需要报警，银行告诉他们此事不涉及法律或税务问题，因此无需报警。
她也询问银行是否可以协助联系这名顾客，但因隐私保护规定，银行无法提供相关信息。
他们因此只能借助社交媒体寻人，但随后却接到数通冒充顾客的骚扰电话。
店家呼吁知情人士提供线索，帮助他们早日找到这名顾客，妥善处理退款事宜。

一名不愿具名的女子在社交媒体贴文称，她与丈夫到热门餐厅用餐付账时，收银员以不够零钱为由，拿两颗糖果代替1令吉找给顾客。（取自Threads）
（八打灵再也15日讯）零钱不够，
糖果
来凑！女子申诉
餐馆
称不够零钱，竟将两颗糖当1令吉零钱找给顾客，还差5分钱未找，令她大感不满。
网媒mStar报导，一名不愿具名的女子在社交媒体贴文称，她与丈夫到热门餐厅用餐，付账时收银员以不够零钱为由，拿两颗糖果代替1令吉找给顾客。
ADVERTISEMENT
根据她上传的收据截图，用餐金额为48令吉25仙，柜台收现金50令吉，
找零
1令吉75仙；不过，顾客最终拿到的是两个分别50仙和20仙的硬币，以及两颗巧克力糖。
女子表示贴文“不是爱计较”，但询问“大家真的同意这种做法吗？”
她指这间餐厅食客络绎不绝，生意火爆，当时她坐在位子上，丈夫去柜台结账，最后却看到丈夫拿着两颗糖和两枚硬币回来。
“丈夫尝试问收银员为什么不是找回1令75仙，但收银员却指一颗糖价值50仙，而两颗糖就相等于1令吉。如果店家要这样算的话，那剩下的5仙为什么没有找给我们呢？
“既然如此，我和丈夫就想了一个套路，临走前再点一杯饮料，打算以这两颗糖来支付。”
不过，女子表示他们的“计划”未能实行，因为当他们想要点多一杯饮料时，收银员称第三杯饮料免单，因此无需支付任何金额。
上述帖子引起网民热议，纷纷在评论区留言表示不能接受用糖果取代货币的方式找零钱。
“交易不能这样做”、“哪里可以如此，店家没有零钱，这不是顾客的问题，若是我必会取消交易，更不能接受一颗糖果5毛钱”、“很多餐馆都会准备一罐糖果，免费赠送给食客”、“如果我遇到这样的事，下一回光顾就会带着同样两颗糖，用来支付账单”。

鸡场街文化坊迈入25年，工委会将致力发掘吸引全球游客到访老街的价值。
（马六甲14日讯）
鸡场街文化坊
创立迈入25周年，站在巨人肩膀上的仰望下一个25年，并放眼有朝一日冲出大中华圈，从欧美游客眼中的“唐人街”或“中国城”购物区，跃升进入世界旅游景点版图之一。
鸡场街文化坊自2000年6月9日由已故拿督威拉颜文龙创立以来，初衷是复兴濒临没落的老街，至今已成功发展为中国、香港、台湾、新加坡及澳门游客热衷造访的旅游胜地，如今是世界文化遗产城市核心区的重点区，成为人类所拥有的活文化遗产。
ADVERTISEMENT
规划未来
5年发展蓝图
在走过25个年头后的今天，鸡场街文化坊工委会规划未来5年发展蓝图，重点在于将“
智能生态系统
”引入夜市营运，并吸引来自全球各地游客深入体验老街文化与旅游魅力。
颜天禄表示，中国《人民日报》多次报道及宣传马六甲和鸡场街的新闻。
大马华人对中华文化及教育的坚持和保留，多次刊登于中国报章。
颜天禄：两年内推AI夜市系统
工委会主席拿督威拉颜天禄今日接受《古城》社区报访问时表示，鸡场街在保留传统夜市与商铺经营模式的基础上，预计两年内推介“智能鸡场街夜市生态系统”，鼓励贩商运用人工智能（AI）提升营运效益。
颜天禄表示，鸡场街25年前创立文化坊时，以振兴没落老街为初衷，如今是世遗核心街道。
“例如，可透过大数据演算找出最受欢迎商品，协助摊主精准进货，提升效率与收益。”
他补充，工委会早在7、8年前于鸡场街推动电子支付，如今已被国家银行评选为全国电子支付最活跃地区之一，几乎所有店铺和夜市摊位皆接受TnG、微信、支付宝等付款方式，如今也到了朝向人工智能迈进的阶段。
工委会预计两年内推介“智能鸡场街夜市生态系统”，鼓励贩商运用人工智能提升营运效益。
周边逾20老街仍需带动
他认为，鸡场街作为马六甲老街核心区域，已具成熟稳定的发展模式，但周边超过20条老街仍亟需带动，才能避免华人老城区整体式微。
“我们希望老街文化延伸至荷兰街、马车街、板底街，甚至三宝井和武牙拉也，形塑一个底蕴深厚的文化城市。”
颜天禄指出，鸡场街从一条沉寂的老街华巷，转型为热闹的旅游景点，是文化坊创立之初未曾预见的发展成果；近年来随着中国开放与崛起，鸡场街乘势而起，成功走向国际。
“未来我希望鸡场街能在世界旅游版图中占有一席之地，吸引的不只是华人游客，更是来自世界各国的旅人。”
拟强化对全球游客吸引力
他坦言，美游客现阶段更偏好红屋、古城门等殖民遗迹，往往仅将鸡场街视为“唐人街式”购物街区；因此，工委会将努力发掘并强化鸡场街对全球游客的吸引力和文化价值。
25岁的鸡场街文化坊，如今站在巨人肩膀上仰望下一个25年。
文化底蕴 历史意义  更吸引中国游客
颜天禄表示，对中国人而言，鸡场街文化底蕴和历史意义胜于旅游氛围，这源自于3个主要载体：（一）郑和七下西洋，五次停驻马六甲，曾在老街区设立官厂，是传播和平精神的辐射地；（二）马六甲是马来西亚和中国友谊的起源地；（三）传播娘惹文化的堡垒地。
每月接待约20组中访问团
他说，鸡场街每月接待约20组来自中国的贵宾与访问团，这些团体在深入了解鸡场街历史后，回国积极推广，包括《人民日报》、新华社、中央电视台等主流媒体也持续报道，进一步引发中国游客对鸡场街的兴趣。
与中25街道景区缔友好关系
他也说，鸡场街已与中国25个街道景区缔结友好关系，促成双方宣传合作、经贸往来与教育交流，为马六甲带来实质效益。
“华人先辈在这片土地留下的中华文化和华文教育，保存与发展得宜，正是吸引中国游客的重要因素。许多游客都说：到了马六甲没到鸡场街，就不算来过马六甲。”
他指出，现今的中国游客对马六甲的认识，已超越课本中的“马六甲海峡”，他们更了解郑和620年前留下的历史足迹，以及对马来西亚华社所带来的影响。
电子支付在鸡场街夜市已经普遍化，是时候引入人工智能。
马六甲娘惹文化吸引游客探索及体验，纷纷穿上娘惹服装拍照。
工委会盼望鸡场街未来在世界旅游地图中占有一席之位，吸引各国游客来探索旅游。

他说，大马是个多元社会，
孝道
的价值超越族群与信仰，庆祝双亲节不仅是为父母送上献礼，主要是提醒所有人需珍惜眼前人、感恩养育恩、传承孝亲情且行孝要及时。
陈宗提及，紫泰阁医药组设有中医治疗和免费施医赠药，明光眼科也免费为民众检验眼睛；福利组扶助弱势群体、施贫敬老、不分种族协助需要帮助的弱势群体；教育组创办德育班，教导道德教育，为国家社会培育具备优良文化及良好德育品行的下一代。

“我们举办爱吾双亲晚宴，希望在日益繁忙、冷漠的社会节奏中，让一家人能够围坐一起好好吃一顿饭，说一句‘谢谢爸妈’。”

9阁社代表张君国在会上以晚宴上的首道药膳汤为引，分享汉文帝“亲尝汤药”，为母亲试药温度的故事，强调孝行无关身份高低，不论天子庶民，皆有尽孝的责任。
他指出，孝道应发自内心，而非流于形式。他也提醒大家在庆祝双亲节时，须反思是否真正出于感恩之情。

他进一步引用《论语》中的多则经典，阐述“孝”的精神内涵，即孝不仅在于物质供养，更在于内心的敬意与态度。
他认为，现代社会中不少人对陌生人和颜悦色，却常对至亲缺乏耐心，这正是孝道教育应着力之处。
张君国还强调，德教会推崇“孝悌文化”，正是因其是立身之本、为仁之源。他引用孔子“孝弟也者，其为仁之本与”的论述，说明孝顺父母、尊重长辈的人，自然也更懂感恩与宽容，是社会安定的重要根基。
以“孝”贯穿全场，4名主持人通过多种典故串场，意义深厚。
德育班约70名孩童齐诵《孝经》选段，为晚宴掀开序幕。
他也在会上提到，9阁社对于此次举办双亲节的方向是一致的，虽是首例联办，但大家都认为这是能起到资源整合的好方式，希望来年能延续下去。
晚宴以孝道入门仪式开始，由9阁社代表逐一敲响孝心鼓入场，随后，德育班约70名孩童齐诵《孝经》选段，为晚宴拉开序幕。
会上通过象征净心迎礼的“盥洗礼”仪式，以清净心态学习和体悟孝道精义。
接着登场的是象征净心迎礼的“盥洗礼”仪式，由司仪领入，带领全体宾客净口、净心、净身，寓意摒除杂念，以清净心态学习和体悟孝道精义。
全场最动容的时刻，莫过于奉茶礼环节，晚辈们双手捧茶，向在座父母长辈躬身行礼奉上热茶；随后的孝道传承仪式，则是由家庭成员共同系上象征“孝心结”的红绳，并共同诵读《孝亲三诺》，以“养亲之身，悦亲之心，承亲之志”传递出坚定不移的孝道承诺。
李清仪（左二）和丈夫江韦延认为，德育班对孩子的品格发展和正确道德观有很大的助益。他们也欣慰孩子已会在家中体恤家长的辛劳。
德育班学员家长李清仪与丈夫江韦延带着9岁和6岁的儿女出席晚宴。
她表示，孩子们参加德育班，不单可提升社交能力和加强中文学习，也对品格发展和道德观带来很大的助益，如今在家中会体恤家长的辛劳，让她与丈夫非常欣慰。
郑欣健（左二）接领孩子奉上的热茶，并透露家人特地南下共聚，回顾父母养育之恩。
郑欣健家中高寿98岁的长辈不便出席晚宴，但他与家人们还是特地远从兴楼南下赴宴，同叙叙天伦，也一起在会上分享对父母的养育之恩的感谢与回忆。
锺氏姐妹向母亲躬身行礼，并恭敬以茶载道，孝心不言而喻。

紫銮阁阁长拿督斯里彭志强表示，百善孝为先，孝道是中华传统文化里的美德，不仅能培养
感恩
之心，同时也是做人的根本，有助于建立个人的道德品质。
“长辈们的要求很简单，那就是关怀与陪伴，因此呼吁远在他乡的
游子
，有时间多多回家看看年迈的父母，给予他们关怀，履行孝道。”
ADVERTISEMENT
他指出，目前社会充斥着不良风气，社媒不时报道负面新闻，其中包括子弑母、老人院不足等，种种迹象凸显出孝道逐渐被人们遗忘，唯有提升人们的道德水平，才能让长辈活得更有自信。
居銮德教会紫銮阁成员与获得大奖3000令吉的幸运儿合影。
“我们是以德行教，以十章八则来教化人群，以孝为首端正人心，导人向善，传承中华优良道德经典教育。”
彭志强向出席者介绍乐龄日活动，并希望类似活动能继续举办。
他说，紫銮阁自上个月开始启动疫情期间停办的乐龄日，相信就是送给长者最好的双亲节礼物，让长者有个欢乐共聚的地方，让他们活得更精彩、开心、自信及有尊严。
彭志强昨晚在居銮场“百行孝为先—父母恩、子女情——爱吾双亲”晚宴上，发表上述谈话。晚宴获约900人踊跃出席，共庆双亲节。

“大家走进紫銮阁，抬头一望，阁所大门口墙壁上高高挂著一个大型孝字，突显出紫銮阁的中心思想：孝道。”
她说，紫銮阁成员以善心化育众生，以德行垂范社群，《星洲日报》作为马来西亚传统中文媒体，除了传送资讯，也肩负协助大马华社推展教育及保留中华文化的使命，两者维持大马华社热爱与传承中华文化的理念高度契合。

郑明发：首次进行全国幸运抽奖
马来西亚德教联合总会总会长兼巴生德教会紫生阁阁长拿督斯里郑明发在主场致词时指出，这项盛会源自巴生，今日已扩展至全国，今晚动员33个属会、设下全国共700席，逾7000人共襄盛举，“一同为孝道发声，为亲情举杯”。
他说，这不仅是个晚宴，更是全国一场“同心、同孝、同步”的大团圆晚宴，现场同步直播至各地，连抽奖环节也首次以全国幸运抽奖形式进行，这种创举，是科技与爱心的结合，是德教精神的延伸。
“百行孝为先，是中华文化的根，而孝道文化也是德教秉持十章八则中排行首位。在过去10年，我领导的巴生德教会紫生阁就与星洲日报联办双亲节晚宴，深受社区认同与支持，成为本地一项备受期待的年度亲情盛会。”
实践以德化世以孝齐家
他说，德联总会如今决定将这份有温度、有意义的传统推广至全国，让“孝”，不仅存在于讲台上、书本中，而是真实走进每一个家庭、每一个晚饭的对话里。
“希望透过今晚的晚宴，让父母感受到来自子女的感恩，也让子女学会勇敢表达爱。同时，也希望此晚宴能成为邻里之间的温暖连结，让三代同堂，亲情相聚，真正实践‘以德化世、以孝齐家’。”
他说，让“孝”活在生活里、让“爱”说出口。不论生活中多忙多累，请记得给父母一个拥抱、一个问候及一顿团圆饭，这就是最真实的幸福。
盼明年获万人参与

许春：孝行体现修养感恩心
星洲媒体集团执行董事兼星洲日报首席执行员许春表示，孝敬父母不仅是家庭伦理中最珍贵的情感，更是个人修养与感恩心的体现。
他说，一个人的最高价值不是他拥有多少财富，而是在于是否懂得感恩。回馈社会是懂得感恩社会的栽培，孝敬父母是懂得感恩父母的养育之恩。
“如今生活环境及经济条件的改变，让人与人之间的亲情变质。许多年轻人把爱倾注在孩子的身上，却忽略了年迈父母的需要，甚至把父母送往安老院后鲜少探望。”
他说，无论多忙碌，也应抽空陪伴父母，尤其节庆期间更应团聚，让长辈感受到温暖。
此外，他指出，星洲日报持续推动各类节庆活动，包括“爱吾双亲”晚宴，正是为了搭建亲情交流的平台，让一家人有机会围坐共享温情时光。
他强调，家庭不是谈条件的地方，而是谈爱的地方，希望通过这样的晚宴唤起更多人重视亲情，传承孝道。
吴添泉：推广孝道共建温情社会
华总中委拿督李德华代读华总总会长丹斯里吴添泉讲稿时指出，此双亲节晚宴已推广多年，旨在推广孝亲敬老、合家和融的优良中华文化，值得华社和全民配合与支持。
他希望更多团体与媒体仿效，持续推动类似活动，在“昌明大马”愿景下，共同营造一个充满亲情与温情的社会。
“人生不同阶段皆活在‘期盼’中，从为人孙到为人父母，再到年老期盼子孙绕膝，其中中年阶段最为不易，上有老、下有小，常常疲于奔命。步入老年后，更需要用智慧应对家庭关系，见机行事、体谅包容，才能换来家和子孝。”
他强调，人与人之间的关系需要双向沟通，孝顺也不例外。若一味主观付出，而非父母所需所想，反而“孝了心却未必顺了意”。真正的孝顺，不只在于“孝”，更重要的是要做到“顺”。
“孝顺是跨族群、跨宗教的美德，中华文化更是以‘百行孝为先’为核心，古今不乏流传至今的感人孝行，至今仍具启发意义。”

（文德甲15日讯）
马华
总秘书拿督
张盛闻
说，各区会代表大会可以自由辩论马华未来动向，同时也可以提呈议案给各州联委会，让该党中央更了解区会想法，进行分析，以在
中央代表大会
作出最终决策。
他说，马华总会长拿督斯里魏家祥曾在全国区会主席汇报会上向三四百位与会代表强调，鼓励大家在代表大会上畅所欲言，表达对下届大选的想法，“让我们在一个月时间内了解全国各地马华各区会想法。”
ADVERTISEMENT
张盛闻也是马华彭亨州联委会主席。他今日为马华淡马鲁区会、区团暨区会妇女组三机构联合代表大会主持开幕时这么说。
他相信彭亨州也没有一个区会是有完全相同的想法，各区会都要各自考量。
“这就是我们要听到最真诚、最认真、最道地的想法，以反映出全国各地的情况，好让我们做出一个更加接地气，与党员们站在一起的立场。
“区会表达的是区会的意见，最终决定权落在全国中央代表大会，党章清楚阐明中央代表大会是党最高决策机构。
“中委会将党中央通过的议案，用赋予的权力加以执行。”
与此同时，张盛闻说，今年是马华备战的一年，沙巴州议会即将解散，马华正积极谈判议席分配，马华肯定会参选。
他指出，团结政府目前面对三大挑战，分别是一）沙巴州选举即将举行，议席分配至今仍未谈出一个结果；二）公正党改选引发的震荡，两位部长辞职；以及三）投资、贸易及工业部长东姑赛夫鲁退出巫统，加入公正党，引起巫统不满。
他说，团结政府目前陷入不稳定，还祭出一系列劳民伤财的政策，包括早前流传小贩禁用家用煤气、扩大销售与服务税税率（SST）及电费酝酿涨价等，这些问题都是因为2018年换政府后取消消费税（GST）的后果。
他说，根据数据显示，国阵政府于2015年4月1日正式推出消费税，在短短8个月时间征收到377亿令吉、2016年税收达557亿令吉、2017年达605亿令吉、2018年1月至5月（倒台前）则达309亿令吉，可是换了政府后，2019年一整年销售及服务税收却仅达276亿，都不比2018年5个月税收多。
“2020年或受冠病影响，税收降至252亿令吉、2021年255亿令吉、2022年稍微增加至313亿，这意味着销售及服务税收入仅达消费税的一半。
“今天所有问题，主要原因是政府不愿意重启消费税。”
他认为，重启消费税最多被人取笑两个星期，最重要是对国家发展有利；做错了，纠正过来时很普通的事情。
“消费税刚推出的首两年出现很多问题，或者退税时间长等问题，政府应纠正这些问题，而不是马上废除，使到国库空虚，需要绞尽脑汁增加税收。”
他说，马华最近频频对政府提出各种意见，因为这些涉及人民基本生活的课题。
他说，马华是个务实政党，当政策行不通就会提出另外一个想法，逐步去推动改进，过去的例子有独中生统考文凭不受承认，马华便逐步开拓独中生的出路，包括协助统考生到台湾深造；通过私立大专法令，允许独中生用统考文凭进入私立大学；开放独中生以统考文凭向高等教育基金局申请借贷；开放统考生进入师训当老师等。
出席者有马华淡马鲁区会主席拿督黄达柱、区会顾问拿督王亚礼、署理主席黄定发、秘书颜暐虔、副主席梁进武、陈冠复、陈世昌、林春诠、组织秘书兼大会议长叶江强、财政黄锦发、区团团长黄启政、妇女组主席罗婉仪和妇女组顾问张玉裘等。

（马六甲15日讯）
圣约翰救伤机构
甲州汉都亚再也区将于6月28及29日，在马六甲皇冠百利广场举办圣约翰健康嘉年华，以便通过多元互动活动推广急救知识与健康生活方式，全面提升社区应对紧急情况的能力。
蔡燕妮：急救知识 从小学起
圣约翰救伤机构甲州汉都亚再也区指挥官蔡燕妮在新闻发布会上表示，这次的健康嘉年华涵盖各年龄层参与者，活动包括
心肺复苏术

她指出，儿童急救挑战赛则是让儿童从小学习应对意外的技巧，培养安全意识与责任感。
“这是欧美发起的一项计划，因为很多时候大部分时间在家里的都是小孩与老人，而老人往往不知道自己有中风的风险，因此我们要小朋友学习如何辨识中风前兆及急救知识，提早辨识，复原几率高，开放给3至12岁小孩学习。”
她表示，捐血运动将和国家血库合作，鼓励市民捐血救人。健康检查与讲座欢迎民众前来免费量血压、血糖、身体质量指数（BMI），并由专业医疗人员主讲的健康讲座，与及提供一对一饮食健康咨询服务。
她说，儿童填色比赛也将会融合急救元素与创意美术，寓教于乐。

义卖AED及急救包
她表示，现场也有进行AED及急救包慈善义卖，所得善款将用于支持急救教育推广计划。
她说，救护车展示是让公众近距离了解救护车内部设备及其在紧急医疗情况中的功能与作用，也让大家有机会拍照留念。
此外，她也说，现代社会中突发事件频传，他们相信“人人会急救，人人能施救” 的社会将更有韧性。通过这场健康嘉年华，希望向大众传达急救不应只交由专业人士，更应成为全民基本技能。
“我们的目标不仅仅是推广健康知识，更要搭建一个社区交流与参与的平台，激发民众对公共卫生议题的关注与行动力。”
她指出，除了填色比赛及心肺复苏术比赛需预先报名及报名费，其他活动都是免费入场。
她感谢该嘉年华主要赞助商Master Tec Wire & Cable有限公司赞助1万令吉充当整场活动的经费。该公司已经连续多年支持圣约翰及社区活动，希望各大企业能够效仿该公司。
她也感谢其他赞助及支持单位，包括马六甲皇冠百利广场、马六甲州卫生局、血库中心、Vitalfour、Kotra Pharma有限公司、益昌咖啡有限公司、Caroma Cafe Food有限公司、NTW Malaysia (HRD Corp)、Smart Media Advertising有限公司、Boehringer Ingelheim有限公司，以及多家本地企业与社团。

由紫嘉阁主办的“父母恩，子女情一一爱吾双亲”晚宴吉隆坡场筵开52席，同时也邀请雪隆区12个慈善团体及老人院代表出席。（辛柄耀摄）
（吉隆坡15日讯）吉隆坡德教会紫嘉阁首次主办百善孝为先“父母恩，子女情一一爱吾双亲”晚宴，约500人共聚一堂，同时也邀请雪隆区内的慈善团体代表出席，共庆双亲节，传递孝道的精神。
这项晚宴是由马来西亚德教联合总会与星洲日报主催，国内各地区德教会与星洲日报联办，全国共有14场次于昨晚同步进行，参与人数超过7000人；总主场在巴生展开，至于由紫嘉阁承办的吉隆坡场则是在旧巴生路崇文华小礼堂热烈举行。
ADVERTISEMENT
林福兴：孝道符合德教十章八则
紫嘉阁阁长兼大会主席林福兴致词时表示，所谓孝亲就是孝敬父母，以感恩心回报自己父母，而敬老就是以行动尊敬老人，所以亲敬老从文化上来说，就是宣扬中华文化的孝道，也促进亲子关系。
他说，其实，孝道也符合德教会所奉行的“十章”和“八则”；所谓“十章”就是 孝、悌、忠、信、礼、义、廉、耻、仁及智，是修身进德的中心思想，而“八则”是不欺、不伪、不贪、不妄、不骄、不怠、不怨及不恶，为德生日常生活之行为标准。
他也说，晚宴也可以说是德教会宣传“十章”、“八则”中重要的“孝道”，是非常有意义的活动。
他也趁机感恩在座各位的爱护与捐助，让这次双亲节晚宴顺利举行。
此外，他指出，这次晚宴也获得12间慈善福利机构及老人院的参与，让晚宴更具意义。出席团体包括蕉赖菩提之家、大马大爱脑伤症基金会、温馨老人之家、大慈讲堂、宋昭阁福利组、恩惠之家（雅尔花园）、马来西亚大众身障社福、金山老人院、太上老君庙福利组、德胜之家、Pusat Jagaan SVM及锡米山福利之家。
紫嘉阁全体理事与嘉宾上台敬酒。前排左起为黄顺兴、李忠诚、黄福兴、林建发、罗燊森、李长特、杨仁川、林福兴、许嵄智、纪华发、许佃才、周连琼、郑汉松、高益文、潘顺及林辉宝。（辛柄耀摄）
杨仁川：身教比学校教育更重要
另一方面，受邀出席的马来西亚德教联合会总会署理总会长杨仁川致词时则说，德教会的“十章”、“八则”中是以“孝”为先，在看到这个社会变迁迅速，很多家庭都是双亲均在外工作，或许导致亲子间的联系与亲情味减少，这也促成德教会主办双亲节晚宴。
他说，紫嘉阁今年配合延开52席，而吉隆坡区内还有数个德教会友阁，希望往后能联手主办，让双亲节晚宴突破千桌。
“今年是我们第一次尝试，可能明年可以再增加（席位）。”
杨仁川也说，孝道在中华文化是非常重要，但现今社会中的种种问题，比如老人院中的华裔比例很高、医院中的老人没有家人接出院及老人没有能力承担医药等，都值得我们深思。
他表示，人类与动物不同，一出生就可独立自主生活，而是由父母亲的照顾和看护，以及细心的教导之下才能够成长，换言之没有父母亲就没有今天的我们。
他也认为，身教比学校教育更重要，比如这次晚宴父母把孩子一起带出来，身体力行将与家人团圆、相互了解展现给孩子看，也能将家庭温暖带给孩子。
纪华发：感谢朋友商家踊跃响应
紫嘉阁署理阁长兼筹委会主席拿督纪华发则说，这次晚宴是配合总会联办及连线这场双亲节晚宴，而他也很高兴看到大家把自己和父母带来参与这次晚宴，与其他长者一起庆祝双亲节。
此外，他也感谢身边朋友及商家的踊跃响应，包括赞助及购票，带着朋友及家人一起参与晚宴。
“还有人报效老人院，把很多我们所尊重的长者带来，一起庆祝。”
出席者包括紫嘉阁名誉顾问拿督斯里陈财和、副阁长拿督周连琼、财政许佃才、副财政黄福兴、法律顾问郑汉松、林建发、总务罗燊森、青年团长黄顺兴、理事潘顺、林辉宝、马来西亚德教联合会总会总务李长特、文德甲德教会紫亨阁副阁长李忠诚、雪隆德教会紫芳阁原任理事会阁长拿督许嵄智及星洲日报中马区高级主任高益文等人。

古来苏丹依布拉欣国中于周六，在学校礼堂举办60周年校庆筹款晚宴。（林金兰摄）
（新山15日讯）
古来苏丹依布拉欣国中
昨晚举办
60周年校庆筹款晚宴
，逾300名校友从八方赶来赴会，不仅“回家”为母校献力，也与多年未见的师长和同学叙旧话当年。
筹款晚宴于昨晚8时在该校礼堂进行，许多校友及退休教职员在晚上7时许陆续抵达，欢喜与退休教师及旧同窗相聚。有人发已斑白，有人面容起皱，历经风霜，但当年深厚情谊依然不变。
ADVERTISEMENT
适逢该校文物馆甫设立，馆内收藏丰富历史照片，不少人结伴参观之际，纷纷拿起手机拍照，记下这难得一刻。
筹款晚宴以别开生面的三大种族击鼓表演掀开序幕，华巫印裔学生分成三组，各别击奏各民族鼓乐，象征各族和谐共融。
阿希克吁为学校建设贡献力量
校友会主席阿希克在会上致词时，感谢参与此次筹款晚宴及校庆义卖会的师生团队，也感恩校友全力支持。

森美兰客家公会联合会新届理事在完成改选后，合影留念，坐者左起为汤亚义、叶玟豪、黄俊棠、陈怀国、黄国强、叶志发、黄新发、蔡忠辉、郑启文、李星辉、孔令年、叶丽明。
（芙蓉15日讯）拉50个人入会，换一趟免费旅行！
森美兰客家公会联合会出新招，推出会员招募奖励机制，会员只要成功介绍50名新会员加入，便可获得一份旅游配套，既为公会注入新血，也为乡亲们提供额外“动力”。
ADVERTISEMENT
卸任会长拿督斯里黄新发今日在森客联举办的2025年度会员大会上致词时，作出上述宣布。
他指出，凡任何一名会员能招收50名新会员，都能享有旅游配套，他希望会员们齐心协力，广招会员。
他补充，目前公会拥有逾400名会员，希望透过这项新措施，未来一年内会员人数能突破1000人大关。
他说，乡团组织近年来普遍面对会员老龄化的问题，急需吸纳年轻会员加入，以确保会务延续与发展。
“我一直呼吁和鼓励年轻人踊跃加入会馆，壮大组织阵容，避免青黄不接的现象。我们必须主动融入年轻人的视野与想法，举办更多吸引年轻一代参与的活动，让他们认识并传承客家文化与精神。”
他也鼓励会员们积极参与会馆三大机构所主办的各项活动，共同推动客家文化传承与发展。
他说，除了文化传承，乡团组织也肩负联系乡亲、互助互勉的使命，并致力在政治、经济、文化与教育领域积极培养下一代，为社会贡献力量。
他提到，会员子女若符合资格可申请成绩优良奖励金，借此鼓励学生努力求学，然而，今年的申请人数并不踊跃，希望未来有更多会员子女踊跃申请，善用会馆福利。
出席者有永久名誉会长兼大会议长陈怀国、顾问拿督郑启文、会务黄俊棠。
小学组会员子女学业优良奖励金得奖者，与嘉宾们合影。
另一方面，黄新发也针对大学预科班录取机制指出，首相安华去年宣布，凡在大马教育文凭考试（SPM）中考获10A及以上成绩者，不分种族可自动获得预科班入学资格，这原本是一项公平且积极的教育改革举措。
不过，他批评教育部在今年4月30日突然调整标准，规定A-成绩不再被纳入A等级，导致部分优秀学子因此被拒之门外。据了解，今年共有逾1万4000名考生考获全A，但其中约4680人因有A-而不被视为“全A”，无法受惠于上述政策。
“教育改革不能一蹴而就，但必须认清问题的严重性，公平的教育制度才能真正照亮所有学子的前途，不分种族背景，若越来越多优秀学生选择出国升学与定居，大马将面临人才流失，失去未来社会与经济的中坚力量。”
因此，他呼吁政府公开透明地公布预科班录取标准与机制，确保录取制度公平、公正及具绩效导向，让更多符合资格的优秀学生有机会进入本地高等学府，也能减轻家长的经济负担，避免人才外流。
出席的会员举手一致通过，将永久个人会员的入会费，从100令吉调至200令吉。
大会今日也举行了理事会改选，在初选提名阶段，共有17人获提名，而理事会共有17个职务，意味着最终全员在无竞争下顺利当选新一届理事。
在新届理事会中，由原任署理会长拿督黄国强接棒出任会长，青年团团长职则由曹富善接任，妇女组主任一职由叶丽明顺利连任。
此外，大会上也接获一份提案，建议将永久个人会员的入会费，从现有的100令吉调升至200令吉，理由是配合时代发展及应对通货膨胀带来的成本增加。
提案在会上获得会员们一致通过，意味着新会员日后需缴付调整后的入会费用。
大会也颁发了课外活动优越奖。

除了歌舞，戏剧团也透过《有福》这部客家话剧，带出客家人隔代之间的不同想法，反思传承的意义。青年团团长游思铭也带来客家相声《教孻子》（教儿子），让大家体会客家话之美。
槟州客家公会会长拿督彭永添致词时说，该会努力培养青年人才，举办多元化的活动，如：客家歌谣、传统饮食文化节、方言学习班、历史讲座等，尤其是为了让年轻人深入了解并认同自己的籍贯文化，激发身为客家人自豪感。
他说，槟州客家公会在全槟乡团中表现活跃，是为数不多持续推动文化项目前进的组织之一。该会将更加专注于文化的 “传承”与“ 保护”，通过开设客家语言课程、纪录片拍摄、口述历史计划、非物质文化遗产申报等方式，加强对客家语言、传统节日、礼俗信仰、手工艺等各层面文化的保存与传扬，确保客家文化能够继续扎根社会、薪火相传、生生不息。
他坦言，在全球化与现代化的冲击下，客家文化正面临逐渐边缘化甚至流逝的风险，许多年轻人不再会讲客家话，对客家传统节庆与民俗知之甚少。
他说，该会秉持“传承文化、服务乡亲、团结同侪”的宗旨，积极推动文化、教育与福利事业。该会长期举办和参与客家文化习俗相关的活动，包括：花布手工艺品与蓝染展示、籍贯舞台表演（客家话剧、武术、歌谣、相声）、客家美食体验、客语学习班、客家新年传统、客家文化概况展示、设立客家文物馆、走入校园办比赛、敬老活动等。
槟州客家公会在会上移交1万5000令吉捐款给时中小学，由该校董事会财政张耀隆和校长罗小菁代表接领。大会也颁发奖励金给会员子女，嘉宾与董事也配合双亲节上台切喜糕。
与会者尚有该会署理主席容耀群、副会长拿督刘志荣、吴允行、贺世敏、总务邱文发、副财政戴礼敏、福利组主任吴亚华、文教部主任游建祥、青年团团长游思铭、妇女组主任王燕燕、董事罗伟超。
魏子森：加入社团传承文化
槟州行政议员魏子森说，在很多急速发展的城市中，地缘或血缘组织已经名存实亡，槟州虽然也面对发展的洪流，在文化传承方面却非常强大。
不过，他认为这个工作不能只靠少数的个人或组织来推动，他鼓励大家加入社团组织一起努力。
他说，人工智能虽然“有问必答”，但是有一些问题是它无法解答的问题只有透过代代传承才能得到领会，而浓厚的客家乡亲也是冰冷的科技所无法取代的。
彭永添（右起）在魏子森的见证下，移交1万5000令吉的捐款模拟支票予时中小学，由张耀隆和罗小菁代表接领。

“还有很长的时间，我们没有必要于今天就要脱离或单飞，这些都不重要。目前最至关重要的是，我们必须从现在开始强化马华淡马鲁区会的影响力。
“本区马华党员多达6000人，其中4000人为淡马鲁国会选民，我们的目标就是将找回党员支持马华候选人。
“以前很多马华党员没有投选马华，但是我相信如果我们找他们，他们肯定会投我们（马华）。”

焦点社区：双溪毛糯拉曼太子岭
（双溪毛糯15日讯）经过多年的坚持与努力，双溪毛糯拉曼太子岭（Bukit Rahman Putra）居民终在司法抗争中获得胜利，获得法庭支持推翻
地方政府
批准征用地段建路的决定，成功保住作为该区唯一的休闲
草场
。
据了解，士拉央市议会是以缓解当地的交通问题，批准发展商征用草场部分路段扩建为道路，这也引起当地居民及草场使用者自2019年展开抗争工作，包括曾多次致函市议会、雪州大臣及该区国州议员，反映诉求与心声。
ADVERTISEMENT
基于屡次与有关当局商讨及对话不果下，当地居民于2023年入禀法庭，在长达2年的司法审核（judicial review）下，终于在早前迎来好消息。
当地居民代表昨日召开新闻发布会宣布，法庭裁决撤销批准在草场砍树及扩建道路的决定，同时只允许市议会进行维护及保养草场的工作。
同时，他们也说，如果市议会提出上诉，他们也将会继续捍卫到底。

林健聪：成立协会联合入禀法庭
当地居民，也是起诉人之一的林健聪指出，司法审核是在2023年10月23日开始，并在今年3月24日在沙亚南高庭进行法庭审理（hearing），最终在5月29日作出裁决。
他说，为了捍卫草场作为公共休闲场所不应被征用建路，加上受到敦依斯迈花园（TTDI）及丽阳英达（Tropicana Indah）居民的启发，因此决定通过司法途径进行争取。
他也说，一群反对草场被征用的居民也聚在一起，成立“拉曼太子岭乐龄协会”（Persatuan Warga Emas Bukit Rahman），由该会及数名数名居民以个人名义，联合入禀法庭。
他透露，他们幸运获得很好的律师，不仅开出优惠的价格，甚至在还未获得律师费下，仍然尽力为他们争取应有的利益；而这次司法程序所需的律师费大约8万令吉，目前还剩约1万令吉的尾款还未缴清。
“律师费都是由协会通过各种途径向公众筹募所得。筹款工作是很辛苦，但如果案件依然去到上诉，我们还是需要再筹款，继续抗争到底。”

苏莱曼：周末人潮最多可达千人
拉曼太子岭乐龄协会主席苏莱曼表示，附近一带住有不少乐龄长者，而该公园是他们每天运动的主要场所，并且早在2021年是已经被颁布宪报为休闲地段，所以他们决定捍卫自身权益，反对草场被征用建路。
他说，该草场是周围一带唯一的大型休闲场地，占地共7.8英亩，每天有数百人使用，周末人潮最多时更可达到千人，包括有人来打球、跑步或舞蹈。
“附近5至6公里都没有其他休闲场所，最靠近的一个草场是位于10公里之外，周边住区甚至是来自轰埠的居民也会来这个草场运动。”
草场内设有足球场及跑道，毗邻还建有一座有盖篮球场。（陈敬晖摄）
简景培：道路紧靠草场 威胁安全
当地居民简景培表示，草场在被征用扩建道路下，将会有20%至30%的地段被占用，更重要的是道路紧靠着草场，将会为在当地运动者的安全造成威胁。
“你去运动是不可能会接近有车走的地方，对吗？”
他说，扩建新路的理由是，新路将作为公园后方一所学校家长载送孩子上下学的替代路线，以缓解BRP7/1路的繁忙交通情况，但事实上该校学生数量逐年减少，造成该路塞车的主要原因是当地越来越多的房屋发展。
他透露，当地现有共10个住区花园，约有2000个单位，而一项涉及6000户单位的房屋计划正进行中，目前已有500户已经入住，也明显看到塞车情况变得更严重。
发展商应另建新路
他认为，发展商要做的不是利用草场地段扩建道路，而是应该配合房屋计划另建一条新路供出入，无需以BRP7/1路作为主要路段，才能解决该路的塞车问题。
简景培也说，近年来看到不少人民站出来与地方政府对抗，通过司法途径采取行动以保护公共地段，但同时也看到居民的反应冷淡。
他表示，如果大家都闭上眼睛全然接受，我们所拥有的公共及休闲场地将会越来越少。

（双溪古月15日讯）马来西亚福建社团联合会青年团（福联青）总团长陈世昌表示，
福联会
作为大马最大乡团组织，在出现不同意见及看法时，应通过内部管理和沟通机制来解决分歧，而不是诉诸报章发表不当言论，损害福联会形象和乡亲之间的情谊。
“福联会拥有253个属会，涵盖广泛的乡亲群体，是一个讲究乡情和互谅的非营利组织，我们聚在一起是为了传承福建文化、互帮互助、共谋发展，而非为了任何个人或团体的利益，我们所追求的，是乡亲们的福祉和整个福建社群的和谐与进步。”
ADVERTISEMENT
他指出，在快速变化的时代，人们会面临各种挑战，无论是经济上的转型，还是社会价值观的变迁，团结的乡团都能更好地应对这些挑战，为乡亲提供支持和帮助。
陈世昌昨晚出席双溪古月福建公会57周年、妇女组25周年会庆致词时如此表示，其他出席者包括双溪古月福建公会会长雷文玲、财政杨俊祥、总务雷远胜等。
他强调，福联会不仅要保持大马最大乡团地位，更要成为其他籍贯的典范，因此呼吁乡亲积极参与活动，为乡团发展建言献策，以展现出福建乡团的卓越组织能力、强大凝聚力，并积极贡献社会及传承文化。
828办东盟福建联总活动
“我们要尊重传统，但也要敢于创新，让乡团活动更加贴近时代，吸引更多年轻面孔的加入，让福建精神薪火相传。”
此外，他呼吁乡亲踊跃参与今年8月28日，由福联会主办的东盟福建联谊总会活动，旨在让本地乡团与东盟各国的福建乡亲们加强联系，深化情谊、共同探讨合作机会。

武吉阿瑟区议员钱进一在晚会上透露，他已向砂政府提呈申请，建议为上述两区域增设两个达雅族长（Tuai Rumah）职位，以更好地服务社区，希望不将捎来好消息。

他说，过去一年，多项津贴逐步撤除，包括鸡蛋津贴。今年5月1日开始，鸡蛋津贴已减半，8月1日起将全面取消鸡蛋津贴。此外，政府也在2024年6月10日起取消西马半岛的柴油补贴。虽然东马暂未实施，但这项政策将引发连锁反应，运输成本上升、物价上涨，迟早会影响到每一个人，尤其是偏远地区的长屋居民。
钱进一称，马来西亚财政部宣布从7月1日起扩大销售及服务税（SST）的征税范围。虽然政府强调非必要品与特定服务才会被征税，但在物价上涨、津贴削减的现实中，新政策恐怕会间接影响许多中下阶层人民。

（文德甲15日讯）马华淡马鲁区会主席拿督黄达柱指出，马来西亚是个种族政治主义的国家，无论是巫统、土团党或伊斯兰党都要争取马来人支持，只要谁获得最多马来人支持就是能入主王朝；而在华社方面取得绝大多数的支持，就是在华社有王道。
他说，马华从曾经的辉煌，节节败退至今天的没落，马华自2018年守土失败后，文德甲州议席已连续3届落入行动党手中，对方服务表现却不如马华。
ADVERTISEMENT
“马华是时候自强不息，本区会要社会变成更活跃的团队。我也一直设想如何召集会回当初在党选败北离队的同志，以及交棒给年轻接班人领导。惟，现有的年轻人却寥寥无几。”

他今天在
马华淡马鲁区会、区团、区会妇女组联合代表大会上致词时说呼吁马华元老继续保持活跃，扶持年轻人，同时也必须广招更多年轻人加入，以在本区建立成一个影响力大的政党。
行动党政绩差强人意民怨四起
他也在大会总结时说，
行动党执政后政绩差强人意，民怨四起，马华虽然在政府体系内，但在民主制度下扮演监督和批评政府施政的角色，相信不满政府表现的华人，在来届大选不会再投选行动党，将改投马华。
他继说，目前最重要是，重新召集马华党员和重拾马华的影响力，让华社支持给力马华，那么马华下届大选就会有胜算。
他也说，去年首相拿督斯里安华言之凿凿会，让所有考获10A或以上的大马教育文凭考生自动被录取进入大学预科班，但今年成绩放榜后，教育部突然宣布A-不算A，许多华裔优秀子弟被拒于门外。
他说，华裔族群受到不公平的对待，执政的行动党应据理力争，然而该党却没有，显见该党治国理念不是为了捍卫华人权益，而是不断打击马华，让马华失去华人选票，是个不可信的政党。
“马华有存在的价值，秉持初衷积极捍卫华人的权益，这是我们的责任。”
他说，为了制衡和纠正施政偏差，建议10年换一次政府，未来的政府或会更廉洁，一切权利就在选民手中。
马华淡马鲁区会代表大会由马华总秘书拿督张盛闻开幕。出席嘉宾尚有马华淡马鲁区会顾问拿督王亚礼、署理主席黄定发、秘书颜暐虔、副主席梁进武、陈冠复、陈世昌、林春诠、组织秘书兼大会议长叶江强、财政黄锦发、区团团长黄启政、妇女组主席罗婉仪和妇女组顾问张玉裘等。

他们也欢迎其他族群为相关的先贤争取平反，并强调明年是重要的一年，因为距离大选更靠近，政府会更加关心民心，愿意聆听诉求。
拟明年再办“林连玉行”
今日会员大会通过其中一项提案是“呼吁政府平反林连玉，重新赋予其公民权”，案因强调，如今团结政府应实践转型正义，平反林连玉，纠正过去政府的不正义行为，承认林连玉先生对国家建设的贡献，并重新赋予其公民权。
另一方面，侯渊富在致词时强调，该组织推动宣教与文化传承的工作不曾停歇，去年8月成功举办“林连玉行”，吸引约5000人参与，一同缅怀林连玉，同时为文化资产保存基金筹得约100万令吉善款，明年计划举办第二场“林连玉行”，希望继续得到广泛支持。
他指出，林连玉纪念馆方面，去年参观人数达到10年新高，共接待5803位访客，平均每天接待至少15人，比2023年多出近1500位。
华青对当老师反应淡
他强调，2025年是教育界面对巨大挑战的一年。多年来，华小师资短缺问题久拖未解，不仅暴露政策推动的不足，也反映出华裔青年对教师行业兴趣的持续下降。
“在国中华文班方面，资源更是严重匮乏，许多教师需从中一教到中五，还得四处奔走借用课室授课，工作负担沉重。这些现象不只影响教学质量，也削弱了学生修读母语的动力，形成恶性循环，必须加强关注。”
出席者尚有该基金署理主席廖文辉、副主席姚丽芳、骆展丰、罗志昌、秘书长黄宝玲、财政黄荣庆及副财政何智良等。
林连玉基金常年会员大会通过6项提案：
一、呼吁政府平反林连玉，重新赋予其公民权。
二、呼吁学校加强性平教育和网络伦理教育，并透明化处理性骚扰事件，“零容忍“性骚扰。
三、要求政府加快落实总检察长与检控官分权。
四、呼吁政府确保多元文化根基，坚持尊重与包容的原则。
五、呼吁政府改革选委会和反贪会成员的遴选程序。
六：要求政府落实《政治献金法》。

SEOUL, June 15 (Bernama-Yonhap) -- South Korean President Lee Jae-myung ordered Saturday to come up with measures to prevent the launch of anti-Pyongyang leaflets in areas bordering with North Korea, Yonhap News Agency reported.
  The president's order followed a report that a civic group had launched anti-Pyongyang leaflets from Ganghwa Island in Incheon, west of Seoul, earlier in the day, presidential spokeswoman Kang Yu-jung said in a written briefing.
  Police have since launched an investigation into three balloons discovered in Ganghwa and Gimpo City. These balloons reportedly contained Bible booklets and snacks, but no leaflets with content criticising the North Korean regime.
  "The government has previously said the illegal distribution of anti-Pyongyang leaflets should be halted, as it could jeopardise the safety of border area residents and escalate military tensions on the Korean Peninsula," she said, adding that the government "takes violators' actions very seriously."
  She warned of "stern measures" against those responsible.
  The government is scheduled to discuss comprehensive measures against anti-Pyongyang leaflets launches on Monday.
  Earlier this week, Lee had ordered relevant government agencies to devise measures to counter such launches.
  -- BERNAMA-YONHAP

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean President Lee Jae-myung plans to hold bilateral talks with the leaders of countries attending the G7 summit, with details still being coordinated, his office said on Sunday.
  Lee will depart on Monday for the summit in Canada, National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac told a briefing.
  The presidential office said Seoul was open to holding trilateral talks with Washington and Tokyo, the Yonhap news agency reported.
  Lee was also preparing for potential talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in case he attends, Yonhap said, citing a presidential office official. 
  "By engaging with the leaders of the United States and Japan, we can explore ways to resolve pending economic and trade issues such as tariffs," Wi said.
  Lee plans to hold meetings with leaders of key countries before and after attending the extended session of the summit, Wi added, without naming countries.
  Seoul and Washington are holding working-level tariff talks, crucial for South Korea's export-oriented economy, with key sectors from chips to vehicles and shipbuilding heavily exposed to global trade.
  U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on South Korea, a long time ally with which it has a bilateral free trade deal, and pressed it to pay more for the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed there.
  Lee, a liberal, was elected on June 3 after former conservative leader Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached and ousted over his short-lived declaration of martial law last year.
  The visit will mark Lee's first diplomatic trip since taking office.

第四十三届（2025年）马六甲中学生华语诗歌朗诵比赛初中组及高中组冠军皆由育民中学包揽，赢得全场总冠军。（戴小同摄）
（马六甲14日讯）第四十三届（2025年）马六甲中学生
华语诗歌朗诵比赛
成绩出炉，初中组及高中组冠军皆由育民中学包揽，赢得全场总冠军。
该比赛今年由公教中学举办，今午进行闭幕仪式，并邀请哥打拉沙马那州议员刘志俍主持闭幕仪式。
ADVERTISEMENT
曾衍盛：应避免不合适小动作
该比赛评委代表曾衍盛讲师点评时说，他希望同学们经过这次比赛，将朗诵诗歌的种子在内心种下，并发芽成美好幼苗，将来长大后是一种很好陶冶心情的方式。
他说，在初中组方面，评审认为学生在朗诵时应避免不合适的小动作，比如揉鼻子等，这将容易导致听众的注意力分散。
他指出，不熟悉的诗歌也要避免，以免影响整体流畅度。诗歌讲究意境美，若小动作或咬辞不当，将影响表现。
“有的同学也有没在状态情况，包括心不在焉、心情低落等，一般上比赛难免有心灵上的波折，过程看到其他团队表现卓越，我们可能表现出现胆怯、没自信，这都需要去应付。”
他也提醒初中组同学避免机械化动作，包括避免重复动作过多，肢体语言是希望让观众能够身入其境，但机械化动作将无法带观众进入状况。
不应全程看着纸张
曾衍盛指出，高中组方面，由于是临场给的诗歌，准备时间可能不太充裕，但是同学们应该尽量消化，不应该全程看着纸张，否则没办法和观众有眼神交流，没有交流，就不能带动观众进入意境。
他说，有的同学甚至将纸张拿得过高，以至于挡着了脸部，评委无法看到同学的脸部表情。
“当然在过程也看到有的同学做得好，评委在听诗歌过程中，能够身入其境。”
他也说，语速或语调如果太快没停顿，铺排没有安排妥当，频率从始至终保持，就没办法把情感内容表达出来，整体表现僵硬。
“我们拿到诗歌就要消化，什么时候要铿锵有力，什么时候要快或慢，让人带入意境。”

赖水和：以诗韵滋养心灵
公教中学校长赖水和说，该比赛自1982年由圣大卫国中华文学会播下第一颗种子，便在华教沃土中茁壮生长。其初衷始终如一：以诗韵滋养心灵，以朗诵传承文明，激发学子对诗歌的热爱，提升语言艺术的境界，让中华文化的瑰宝在年轻一代心中熠熠生辉。
他说，从五所华中加上雅佳美浪国中的初心接力，到今日舞台上青春的璀璨绽放，我们见证了无数少年以声为笔、以情为墨，书写对母语的深情。这场赛事不仅是才华的竞技场，更是文化传承的桥梁。
他也感谢刘志俍承诺在任内对华文教育事业的坚定不移的守护，对文化根脉的珍视，为无数学子点亮了前行的灯。
“亲爱的同学们，愿你们将今日的掌声化为明日追梦的羽翼。台上三分钟的光华，源于台下千百次的锤炼；诗句中流淌的不仅是文字，更是民族的魂魄。请永远怀抱这份对诗歌的赤诚，让中华文化的星河在你们的声音里永恒奔涌。”

刘志俍：思想情感凝练表达
哥打拉沙马那州议员刘志俍指出，诗歌是中华文化瑰宝中最动人的乐章，是思想情感的凝练表达，是穿越时空的心灵对话。
“透过一首首饱含深情的诗篇，我们得以触摸历史的温度，感悟人生的哲思，在韵律与意象的熏陶中，滋养人文情怀，淬炼精神境界，让心灵在美的浸润中更加丰盈。”
用声音传递热爱与理解
他指出，今天站在这里的每一位同学不仅仅是诗歌的朗诵者，更是马六甲州华族文化生生不息的重要传承者。他们用声音传递的每一份热爱与理解，都令人动容。
他也说，未来的社会不仅需要掌握人工科技技能与知识，更需要具备深厚文化底蕴、清晰表达能力与开阔人文视野的新生代。
他表示，熟练掌握并热爱华语这门优美的语言，是我们宝贵的文化资产。他衷心期望大家珍视这份对华语、对中华文化的热爱，坚持在阅读中汲取智慧，在书写中沉淀思想，在朗诵中提升自信。
他说，在主办当局的精心安排下，今届赛事将设立一座簇新的全场总冠军常年杯。他深感荣幸，能够捐赠这座承载着期许与祝福的奖杯，希望能激励更多同学在未来的舞台上追求卓越。
此外，刘志俍也宣布拨款5000令吉给大会。
出席者包括甲州教育局华文科助理局长林婷心督学、人才发展组代表诺莱兰、公教中学家协主席戴祖全等。

（吉隆坡15日讯）“2025年第一届拿督王顺和硕士杯全国征文比赛”圆满落幕，中学组和公开组共17人脱颖而出；但值得一提的是，本届有部分参赛作品被发现疑似使用AI撰写，遭主办单位当场淘汰。
福联会妇女组主席兼大会主席林秀琼就坦言，近500份参赛作品中，部分稿件内容高度雷同，明显非人手书写；而主办方最终剔除多篇AI作品，并承诺将制定更完善的评审机制，以捍卫文学创作的原创精神。
ADVERTISEMENT
对此，马来西亚福建社团联合会总会长丹斯里林福山在颁奖典礼致词中也指出，科技再先进，终究无法取代人类的思想与情感。
他表示，文字不仅是记录语言的符号，更是承载智慧的宝盒、传承文化的薪火，先辈们用毛笔书写族谱、以墨水镌刻历史，让后世仍能触摸到祖辈的温度与智慧。
他说，在科技日新月异的时代，子孙辈动辄呼唤“OK Google”或“Hey Siri”，然而，当全球人工智能系统在6月4日突然“罢工”时，许多人恍然惊觉——再先进的科技，终究无法替代人类的思想与情感。
“机器可以模仿文字，却写不出流传千古的《红楼梦》；AI虽然能生成句子，却吟不出具有思意的‘床前明月光’。真正的文学，源于心灵的温度，成于文化的积淀。”
由福联会妇女组举办的《拿督王顺和硕士杯全国征文比赛》是于2月20日发起，征稿期至3月31日截止，共吸引458位参赛者踊跃投稿，其中公开组20人，中学组438人，本届比赛主题为“新时代下的希望与挑战”。
最终，中学组第一名是来自霹雳州曼戎南华独立中学的余婕宁；公开组第一名则是来自砂拉越民都鲁的黄思颖。
另一方面，福联会名誉总会长、妇女组顾问兼全国征文比赛杯主拿督王顺和则表示，非常欣喜地看到，来自全国各地的参赛者，以文字表达内心的声音，用笔触展现思想与才华。
“每一篇作品都独具风格，承载着作者的情感与观点——无论是对社会的深刻观察，或是对人生的真挚体悟，都让我们深深感受到马来西亚人民，特别是年轻一代的无限潜能与文化深度。”
他也勉励所有未获奖的参赛者，强调比赛的结果只是阶段性的呈现，文学的道路是漫长且精彩的，千万不要因为一时的结果而停下脚步。相信每一次的尝试，都将让笔触更加成熟，视野更加开阔。
《拿督王顺和硕士杯全国征文比赛》前身为《丹斯里郑福成杯全国征文比赛》，郑福成此前已担任杯主20年的时间，并在2023年宣布将退位，改为王顺和硕士杯。
今日出席的有福联会永久名誉总会长兼妇女组顾问郑福成、副总会长拿督黄振兴、总秘书拿督威拉林进利、总财长王文海、妇女组总秘书宋彩芬、文教主任沈玉萍、青年团总秘书马忝隆等。

钓客漂浮在海面上，随后被商船救起。
（古晋15日讯）7名男子昨日出海钓鱼时不幸遇上
船只漏水倾覆
事故，所幸在商船协助下全部获救，成功脱离险境。
大马海事执法机构砂分局局长莫哈末凯里今日发文告指出，砂海事执法机构救援中心是在昨日下午4时45分接获来自古晋港务局的通报，指接获一艘商船通过无线电发出的求救讯号。
ADVERTISEMENT
船上7人全掉入海里
“当时，一艘钓鱼船在距离
丹绒波
（Tanjung Po）北方约10海哩的海域发生倾覆，船上
7人全部落海
。”
他透露，其中一名钓客的说法，涉事船只是在上午11时左右因船体舱底出现漏水情况，最终导致船只入水过多侧翻而沉没。
钓客从商船走下，登上海事执法机构的救援船。
他指出，事发时恰巧另一艘商船驶经事故海域，及时展开救援，将7人安全救起。
砂海事局在接获通报后，立即调派“KILAT 35”巡逻艇前往与商船会合，并于当晚7时08分将7名获救者安全送抵敦阿邦沙拉胡海事大厦码头。
莫哈末凯里呼吁所有出海者，特别是钓客与渔民，务必重视出海安全事项，包括穿戴救生衣、检查船只状况以及关注天气情况。
他也提醒民众，若在海上遇紧急事故或发现可疑情况，可拨打砂海事行动中心热线082-432006，或全国紧急热线999，尽速通报以便当局采取救援行动。
医护人员在码头为安全上岸的钓客进行身体检查。

KUCHING, June 15 — The cervical cancer incidence rate in Sarawak stands at 12.1 per 100,000 women, said Rose Foundation programme director Dr Khoo Su Pei.
  She said this was more than double the national average of six per 100,000 women and was one of the key reasons the foundation was focusing its outreach efforts in the state.
  “Sabah and Sarawak have recorded the highest incidence rate of cervical cancer compared to other states in Malaysia — the statistics for Sarawak are 12.1 per 100,000 women, while the national figures are six per 100,000 (women), so it’s almost double,” she told reporters when met during the ‘Free HPV PCR Testing for Cervical Cancer Screening’ programme at Crown Square here yesterday.
  She said the Rose Foundation, which now has a branch in Sarawak, was targeting 200 underprivileged women for screening during this round, with 150 that pre-registered as of June 13.
  The event was also part of a broader national mission to eliminate cervical cancer in Malaysia.
  “Local modelling studies show that to eliminate cervical cancer, we need to reduce the incidence rate to less than four per 100,000 women. If we achieve the 2030 vaccination and screening targets, Malaysia may eliminate this disease by 2055 to 2065,” she said.
  Dr Khoo noted that awareness remained a major challenge.
  “Many still do not know they need cervical screening, or avoid it due to fear. But this HPV test is simple and effective; it is self-sampled and only takes 10 minutes,” she explained.
  Dr Khoo said the one-day screening event was jointly organised by Rose Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in Kuala Lumpur, and the Che Hui Khor Moral Uplifting Society.
  “The test kits we are giving out under this programme are sponsored by Etiqa Cares as part of their CSR initiative. We collaborate with local community-based organisations like Che Hui Khor to promote and organise logistics for such events,” she added.
  She said those who missed today’s event could still access the test at government health clinics or clinics under the National Population and Family Development Board.
  Dr Khoo said the Rose Foundation would be visiting the Sri Aman Hospital, Simunjan Hospital, Sarawak Heart Centre and Sarawak General Hospital from Monday to Friday next week.
  “The foundation works closely with government hospitals like the Sarawak General Hospital to coordinate referrals and appointments for women screened under our programme.”
  Meanwhile, political secretary to the Premier Kho Teck Wan officiated the event on behalf of Deputy Premier Datuk Amar Dr Sim Kui Hian.
  In her speech, she mentioned the strategic reuse of PCR machines that were previously used for Covid-19 testing for HPV tests, which was an initiative proposed by Dr Sim.
  She also commended the Rose Foundation and medical experts involved for driving the meaningful initiative, and emphasised the importance of early prevention.
  “I urge all the ladies here to not only take the HPV test but also ensure your children get vaccinated. This is one of the few preventable cancers,” she added.
  Sharing a poignant story, Kho recalled a case of a man whose 32-year-old wife was diagnosed with cervical cancer too late for curative treatment.
  “She only had about three months left to live. That’s why we must stress early detection and prevention. Please encourage your friends, especially the young ones, to get vaccinated and screened,” she said. — The Borneo Post

子宫颈癌与乳癌是马来西亚女性死亡的主要原因之一，尽管医学科技日益进步，但仍有许多女性因缺乏认知、资源有限、意识薄弱或害怕检查结果，而未能进行早期筛查。
因此，我们迫切需要全面的政策与社区的支持，确保每位女性都能获得守护健康的机会。
ADVERTISEMENT
柔佛州推出WCaRe（Women Cancer Awareness & Response）女性癌症醒觉计划，以确保所有女性都能接受子宫颈癌与乳癌筛查。
这项计划涵盖意识推广、健康检查、谘询服务及必要时的转介治疗，旨在女性群体中推广预防为主的健康理念。
虽然这项计划无法直接提供治疗服务，但我认为它依然是一项有前瞻性的举措与政策，也应该跨党派、跨政治地推行。
去年，士姑来州议员服务中心与国家人口及家庭发展局（LPPKN）及马来西亚国家癌症协会（NCSM）携手推行柔佛WCaRe计划，吸引众多本地女性参与，并在初期阶段筛查出多起癌症个案。
更重要的是，确诊者并非孤立无援，士姑来州议员办公室提供全程陪伴、精神支持与治疗资讯，确保她们能尽早展开有效治疗。
秉持这份承诺，我们将于6月22日（星期日），在士姑来皇后花园礼堂再度举办健康意识活动。活动也获得柔佛家庭发展基金会（YPKDT）与LPPKN的协力支持。
本次活动不仅关注生殖器官癌症的预防，也将强调女性心理健康的重要性，这是往往被忽视却不可或缺的一环，关乎整体生活的安宁与幸福。
我们诚挚呼吁士姑来所有女性把握这次难得的机会，前来免费进行健康检查，并透过专业人士获取有价值的知识与支持。
请记住，早期筛查可以挽救生命。因此，为自己，也为家人的未来，迈出守护健康的第一步。
这类计划不仅在医疗层面带来帮助，更有助建设一个更加关怀、具韧性的社区。
让我们携手努力，减轻癌症负担，共同提升全柔女性的生活品质。

年轻小贩新开业16天，就有41把叉子和10个盘子不翼而飞。（取自8视界新闻网）
（新加坡15日讯）年轻
小贩
在
巴刹
和熟食中心开档，为了环保特别定制
不锈钢餐具
，岂料营业短短16天，就有多达41把叉子和10个盘子
不翼而飞
。
《8视界新闻网》报道，38岁的陈意伟今年4月16日开始在巴刹和熟食中心经营西餐摊位，刚开始营业3天就发现餐具疑似被偷。
ADVERTISEMENT
陈意伟受访时说，他当时发现有10个盘子和16把叉子不翼而飞。“清洁人员通知我，他们在托盘回收区收集盘子的时候，发现叉子不见了。”
营业16天后，不翼而飞的餐具已多达41把叉子和10个盘子。
陈意伟说：“很遗憾的，开业仅仅16天内，我就因为餐具不见而损失了大约50元（新币；约165令吉）。”
清洁公司每年给50新元作为赔偿
据了解，陈意伟并不是唯一一名遭遇餐具被偷窃的小贩，该巴刹和熟食中心的其他小贩也面对这个问题。
陈意伟说：“因为该巴刹和熟食中心的其他小贩也面对这个问题，失窃事件屡见不鲜，清洁公司每年都会给50元作为损失赔偿，但是我在不到一个月内就损失了这个数目。”
他认为，这样的行为不能被容忍，也不能被忽视。
“听到有人把这个行为视为‘新加坡文化’或者把这个状况视为常态，真的很令人沮丧。偷小贩的餐具就像从别人的家中偷取物品一样，是不可被接受的行为。”
促当局安装电眼
陈意伟表示，他已于本月12日报案，警员向他解释，由于丢失的物品较小，而且小贩中心的监控器有限，要找到肇事者有一定的挑战性。
他希望借此促请当局为小贩中心的每个区域都设置监控器，加强保安。
“看到这些小贩们都在努力去解决这个问题，尤其是连年迈的小贩也受到影响，真的很令人难过。允许这类轻微犯罪行为持续发生，真的让人感到很不公平。”
新加坡警方受询时表示，已接获报案，调查仍在进行中。

LOS ANGELES: Penyerang Inter Milan, Mehdi Taremi tidak dapat menyertai pasukannya bagi saingan awal Piala Dunia Kelab selepas terkandas di Tehran susulan konflik yang sedang memuncak antara Iran dan Israel.
  Menurut kenyataan kelab dari Itali itu kelmarin, Taremi yang berusia 32 tahun berada di Iran minggu lalu atas tugasan antarabangsa dan menjaringkan satu gol dalam kemenangan 3-0 ke atas Korea Utara dalam aksi kelayakan Piala Dunia.
  Bagaimanapun, penyerang itu gagal mendapatkan penerbangan ke Los Angeles untuk menyertai kem latihan bersama rakan sepasukan berikutan ketegangan geopolitik yang sedang melanda rantau berkenaan.
  Sumber kelab mengesahkan kepada AFP bahawa Taremi masih berada di negara asalnya dan tidak dapat meninggalkan Tehran buat masa ini.
  Inter dijadual memulakan kempen Piala Dunia Kelab menentang kelab Mexico, Monterrey, Selasa ini di Stadium Rose Bowl, Pasadena, yang terletak di timur Los Angeles.
  Pertemuan itu juga bakal menjadi penampilan sulung Cristian Chivu selaku ketua jurulatih Inter yang baharu, selepas dilantik menggantikan Simone Inzaghi pada Isnin lalu susulan kekalahan memalukan 0-5 kepada Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) dalam final Liga Juara-Juara.
  Dalam sidang akhbar rasmi di Beverly Hills, Chivu menegaskan bahawa skuad kendaliannya bersedia untuk bangkit selepas kekecewaan berganda musim lalu, terlepas gelaran Serie A dan gagal menjulang kejuaraan Eropah.
  “Kita tidak boleh menafikan perjalanan luar biasa pasukan ini. Mereka mara ke peringkat akhir dan menampilkan aksi konsisten sepanjang musim. Ini bukan kegagalan.
  “Kami berjaya menyingkirkan Bayern Munich dan Barcelona dalam saingan Liga Juara-Juara, malah mendahului carta Serie A untuk tempoh yang panjang. Kegagalan sebenar adalah apabila kita mula mencari alasan,” kata Chivu. – AFP

MILAN
:
Inter Milan forward Mehdi Taremi has been stranded in Tehran due to the conflict between Iran and Israel and will miss the start of the Fifa Club World Cup, the Italian club confirmed today.
Taremi was in Iran last week on international duty, scoring in a 3-0 victory over North Korea in a World Cup qualifying game.
However, the 32-year-old was unable to get a flight to join his Inter teammates in Los Angeles due to the ongoing confrontation between Iran and Israel.
An Inter source confirmed to AFP that Taremi was stranded in his homeland.
Inter open their Club World Cup campaign against Mexican side Monterrey on Tuesday at the Pasadena Rose Bowl east of Los Angeles.
The opener marks the first game in charge of new Inter coach Cristian Chivu, who was named on Monday as the successor to Simone Inzaghi, who left following the club’s 5-0 drubbing against Paris St-Germain in the Champions League final.
Speaking at an introductory press conference at the team base in Beverly Hills yesterday, Chivu said Inter were ready to bounce back from the double disappointment of just missing out on the Serie A title as well as the Champions League final.
The 44-year-old former Romanian international said Inter could look back on the season with pride.
“We shouldn’t forget this team’s journey – it was a great season,” Chivu said.
“This team has great quality. They got right to the end but they didn’t get the trophies. It wasn’t a failure of a season.
“We knocked out Bayern and Barca in the Champions League. We were top of the league, one of the best in Europe, for a long time. So we cannot forget this. Failure doesn’t exist in football. Failure is making excuses.”

MANCHESTER: Manchester United optimis bahawa Hugo Ekitike akan berpindah ke Old Trafford dalam jendela perpindahan musim panas ini selepas keutamaan Red Devils adalah membawa masuk seorang penyerang berkualiti tinggi.
  Pengurus United, Ruben Amorim bertekad untuk mendapatkan seorang penyerang bagi meningkatkan peluang pasukan untuk menamatkan saingan di kelompok empat teratas Liga Perdana Inggeris (EPL) musim depan.
  Menurut portal Perancis, FootMercato, United sedang giat mengadakan perbincangan untuk menandatangani Ekitike dari Eintracht Frankfurt dalam jendela perpindahan musim panas ini.
  Red Devils telah mengikuti perkembangan Ekitike sejak zamannya di Reims dan sangat tertarik dengan prestasinya musim lalu.
  Penyerang Perancis itu menjaringkan 22 gol dan mencipta 12 bantuan gol dalam 48 penampilan pada kempen 2024/2025, dengan bekas pemain tengah United, Owen Hargreaves, menggambarkan pemain muda itu sebagai penyerang tengah yang sempurna di TNT Sports pada April lalu.
  United dilaporkan telah mengambil langkah untuk menandatangani Ekitike dan mengadakan pertemuan dengan ejen pemain berusia 22 tahun itu bagi membincangkan butiran kontrak.
  “Perbincangan telah dipercepatkan dalam dua hari lepas antara ejen Hugo Ekitike dan pengurusan United.
  “Perbincangan antara United dan wakil pemain berlangsung dengan baik, menunjukkan minat sebenar Red Devils. Kedua-dua pihak optimis selepas pendekatan positif ini,” tulis laporan FootMercato.
  Laporan itu turut menambah bahawa Red Devils telah menghubungi Eintracht untuk bertanyakan tentang yuran perpindahan yang diperlukan untuk mendapatkan penyerang tersebut.
  Bagaimanapun, bukan United satu-satunya kelab yang berminat mendapatkan Ekitike kerana Liverpool dan Chelsea turut memantau situasi pemain muda itu dan mungkin akan membuat tawaran mereka sendiri. – AGENSI

(Reuters) -Social media platform X showed signs of recovery on Saturday after an outage disrupted access for thousands of users in the United States, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.
  Reports of disruptions had dropped to around 1,041 by 7:42 p.m. ET, down from a peak of more than 10,000, according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from various sources.
  Downdetector's numbers are based on user-submitted reports. The actual number of affected users may vary.
  In May, Musk, who spent nearly $300 million to back U.S. President Donald Trump's presidential campaign and other Republicans last year, said he'll resume working '24/7' at his companies.
  "Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms. I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out," Musk had said in an X post.
  "As evidenced by the X uptime issues this week, major operational improvements need to be made," he added.
  Earlier in March, Musk had blamed a cyberattack after a similar outage at X.
  X did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

KUCHING, June 15 — The Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) has strongly objected to the upcoming port tariff hike at Port Klang, approved by the Ministry of Transport and gazetted on June 13, citing serious concerns over its timing and economic impact.
  The revised tariff structure involves a 30 per cent increase in container handling charges, to be implemented in three phases, beginning July 1, 2025, said FMM president Tan Sri Dato’ Soh Thian Lai in a statement yesterday.
  He added that in addition to the handling charge hike, container storage charges are set to surge between 197 and 243 per cent, posing a significant burden on manufacturers already facing cost pressures from global and domestic headwinds.
  “This comes at a time when industries are already contending with unresolved external shocks, including the ongoing US tariff threats on Malaysian exports, the expansion of the Sales and Service Tax (SST), and a scheduled restructuring of electricity tariffs.
  “The convergence of these cost pressures will deliver a heavy blow to manufacturers and exporters at a critical juncture in Malaysia’s economic recovery, further eroding the country’s export competitiveness,” he said.
  Soh stressed that the sharp cost escalation from July could disrupt the cost structures of both exporters and importers at a critical point in Malaysia’s economic recovery.
  Under the gazetted rates by the Port Klang Authority, container handling charges for a 20-foot container will rise from RM300 to RM390 over three phases.
  With Port Klang handling around 12.5 million TEUs annually, this could translate into an additional RM1.125 billion in annual costs to industry upon full implementation.
  “Malaysian ports have traditionally enjoyed a competitive edge due to reasonable cost structures.
  “However, with the new rates, container handling fees will approach US$120–130 per TEU, similar to rates in Singapore and Hong Kong, but well above Asean neighbours such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand.
  “This will erode Malaysia’s value proposition and increase the risk of cargo diversion to competing regional ports,” he said.
  Soh also pointed to Malaysia’s recent drop to 34th in the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking and its position at 26th in the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index as warning signs.
  He cautioned that the tariff hike sends the wrong message to investors and could undermine business planning and trade flow, especially as manufacturers grapple with narrowing margins and uncertain global conditions.
  Given the cascading effects of multiple policy shifts, Soh called for a holistic review by the government, urging inter-ministerial coordination on cost-related measures affecting businesses and consumers.
  “Port tariffs, SST expansion, electricity hikes and international trade headwinds must be evaluated together.
  “No single ministry or agency can make isolated decisions without assessing the full burden being placed on industry,” he said.
  He urged the government to immediately pause the implementation of the port tariff hike, electricity base tariff revision, and expanded SST scope, and to reconvene with industry stakeholders to reassess the broader economic and operational impact.
  “These cost increases will eventually translate into higher prices for consumers, and a slowdown in manufacturing investment and job creation.
  “FMM stands ready to work with the government to realign policy implementation timelines, ensure transparency in cost justifications, and develop a coordinated national strategy to support industry growth and protect the welfare of consumers,” he said. — The Borneo Post

从网上视频可见张艺兴穿着白色短袖衫，搭配外套，下半身则穿上灰色宽松长裤，当他专心演出时，没想到灰色裤子逐渐滑落，不过他还内搭一条黑色裤子，所以没及时察觉异状。
当张艺兴发现后，便立即用手拉起长裤，之后转身整理，一脸尴尬笑之后，又继续投入演出，过程中有不少观众笑出声，也有网民描述掉裤过程，称此意外为“大型社死现场”。
不过，不少网民认为张艺兴当下反应超淡定，还指他面对突发状况时样子可爱，忍不住夸他：“救命！他拉裤子的动作也太真实了吧？像极了我早上赶地铁裤子滑下来的样子”、“内搭救场！建议所有艺人巡演都学张艺兴，穿两条裤子保平安（不是）”、“社死但可爱！他明明尴尬到脚趾抠地，却还在坚持完成表演，敬业程度拉满”、“原来偶像的‘完美人设’也可以有裂缝？这种真实的笨拙反而更圈粉！”

LONDON:  Women face “real and frightening privacy and safety risks” when using period tracker apps, experts have warned.
  Academics from the University of Cambridge said that personal information in the app can be collected and “sold at scale”.
  A new report from experts at Cambridge’s Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy said that this “poses risks and harms for users”.
  Researchers said that menstrual data can provide insights into people’s health and their reproductive choices.
  These apps can collect information on exercise, diet, medication, sexual preferences, hormone levels and contraception use, they added.
  This information can be a “gold mine” for consumer profiling, the authors of the new report said.
  Many women who download the apps do so when they are trying to get pregnant, which the authors point out leads to a dramatic shift in shopping behaviour.
  “Data on who is pregnant, and who wants to be, has therefore emerged as some of the most sought-after information in digital advertising,” they said.
  The point out how period tracking apps have rapidly risen in popularity, with global downloads of the three most popular apps surpassing 250 million.
  “Cycle tracking apps (CTA) are a lucrative business because they provide the companies behind the apps with access to extremely valuable and fine-grained user data,” the experts wrote in their new report.
  “CTA data is not only commercially valuable and shared with an inextricable net if third parties (thereby making intimate user information exploitable for targeted advertising), but it also poses severe security risks for users.”
  They point out that in the wrong hands, the data collected by the apps could result in health insurance “discrimination”; risks to job prospects or even domestic abuse.
  The research team called for better governance of the “femtech” industry, including improved data security of these apps and for them to introduce “meaningful consent options”.
  They also called for public health bodies to launch alternatives to commercial tracking apps.
  “Menstrual cycle tracking apps are presented as empowering women and addressing the gender health gap,” said Dr Stefanie Felsberger, lead author of the report.
  “Yet the business model behind their services rests on commercial use, selling user data and insights to third parties for profit.”
  “There are real and frightening privacy and safety risks to women as a result of the commodification of the data collected by cycle tracking app companies.”
  Professor Gina Neff, executive director of Cambridge’s Minderoo Centre, added: “The use of cycle tracking apps is at an all-time high.
  “Women deserve better than to have their menstrual tracking data treated as consumer data, but there is a different possible future.” – PA Media/dpa

Q:
I’m trying to educate our 14-year-old daughter about “best practices” for social media before we let her create her own account(s).
I like to get input from various sources. What would you suggest?
A:
First, we commend you for being intentional to educate your daughter on how best to navigate today’s social media.
We compiled a list that we’ve entitled “The Top-10 Social Media Rules” for all ages, but most are especially applicable for teens:
1. Always be kind—treat others the way you want to be treated.
2. View social media as a way to give; consider how things you post can benefit others.
3. Set privacy settings, including location.
4. Don’t chat/message someone you don’t personally know in the “real” world.
5. Please, no sleaze! Modesty trumps “likes” when posting photos. (And remember that everything you post will be available for future “significant others”—and employers—to see.)
6. Nothing should be truly private. Know your children’s passwords and convey that you’ll be friending them and reading their posts. Be sure your children can read yours, too.
7. Refuse to share a post that you haven’t personally verified; that free dinner may just be a scam.
8. Limit your social media consumption/posting to just a few times per day, with parental input.
9. Avoid crudities, vulgarities, profanities or symbols for such. Don’t say it online if you wouldn’t say it to someone’s face.
10. Re-read carefully before you post—without facial expressions and personal contact, the best-intended post may be misinterpreted.
We’d suggest cutting out this list and discussing each guideline with your daughter, then placing it somewhere visible for reference.

LUMUT, June 15 (Bernama) -- Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has expressed his satisfaction with the progress of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) construction by Lumut Naval Shipyard (Lunas) at the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) base here, describing it as commendable.
  He said the progress demonstrated the government’s strong commitment to prioritising national security assets and reflected the MADANI government’s emphasis on good governance.
  “We regard the RMN as a key line of defence, as our waters are not immune to threats such as terrorism, potential foreign incursions and smuggling. That is why I agreed for the LCS project to continue under the Finance Ministry.
  “Previous delays stemmed from weak management, governance issues and corruption. If the management is poor, how can we ensure maritime security? That’s why good governance is essential,” he said in his speech at the Kenduri Rakyat programme held in conjunction with the Perak MADANI Rakyat Programme 2025 at Shariff Hall, RMN Lumut here today.
  Also present was Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil.
  Earlier, the prime minister visited the Lunas facility at the RMN base to inspect the ongoing LCS construction works.

安华对濒海战舰建造进展感到满意。（马新社图）
（红土坎15日讯）首相拿督斯里安华表示，他对位于皇家海军基地、由红土坎海军造船厂（LUNAS）负责建造的
濒海战斗舰
（LCS）工程进展感到非常满意和感到骄傲！
他说，这项进展证明政府将
国家安全
资产列为优先事项，也是昌明政府改革成果的体现，强调良好治理和问责制。

他今日在皇家海军基地沙里夫礼堂，出席“2025年霹雳州MADANI关怀人民计划”下的“亲民宴”活动时这么表示。出席者包括通讯部长拿督法米。
“我们将皇家海军的角色定位为国家主要防线，因为我国海域难免面对各种可能的威胁，例如恐怖主义、其他国家的攻击、走私活动。因此，我同意由财政部继续推行濒海战斗舰项目。”
“过去的延误是因为管理、治理问题，甚至涉及贪污。如果管理薄弱，又怎能保障海事安全？因此我们不能回避所谓的‘良好治理’。”
较早时，首相前往红土坎海军造船厂参观LCS的建造工程。
与此同时，安华表示，政府一向重视提升国家
防卫
资产的需求，因此国防部是每年财政预算案中获得分配最多拨款的部门之一。
“这是三大（获最多拨款的）部门之一，第一是教育，第二是卫生，第三是国防。单是2025年，国防领域就获拨212亿令吉，对于一个发展中国家来说，这不是小数目，我们给予的是一笔庞大的拨款。”
他表示，政府采取这项举措，是为了肯定安全部队的牺牲奉献，也是为了确保国家安全稳定，因为稳定是推动经济高速发展的关键因素。
他说，每当他得知国家安全设备残旧，心里会觉得难过。
“因此，自从成立昌明政府以来，我就召集三军首长，要求他们列出优先事项，我们会努力筹措充足经费，来提升所需设备与军备。”

LUMUT
:
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim today announced project allocations totalling over RM250 million for the navy base in Lumut, to improve the well-being and welfare of security personnel, among other things.
He said RM65 million has been allocated for the construction of a specialist clinic complex and the upgrading of the armed forces hospital at the base.
Also approved were several key infrastructure projects, including the upgrading of the 33kV high-voltage distribution system, with an allocation of RM100 million, the replacement of the Bulk Fuel Installation (BFI) operational tanks (RM23.3 million), and the upgrading of the operational jetty at the Lumut Base (RM66.5 million).
“I urge the state secretary present here to immediately implement the construction of the specialist clinic complex and the upgrading of the Lumut armed forces hospital, for the well-being of navy personnel,” he said.
Anwar said this at a gathering with the navy personnel here today. Also present were communications minister Fahmi Fadzil and navy chief, Zulhelmy Ithnain.
Meanwhile, Anwar said the government remains attentive to the need to enhance the country’s defence assets, with the defence ministry receiving one of the largest allocations in the annual budget.
“Defence ranks third (in terms of allocation), after education and health. For 2025 alone, RM21.2 billion has been allocated – a significant amount for a developing nation,” he said.
He added that the move reflected the government’s appreciation of the sacrifices made by the security forces and was aimed at ensuring national stability, which is crucial for economic growth.
Anwar said he is often moved when learning of the poor condition of certain security assets that are still in use to safeguard the nation.
“That is why after becoming prime minister, I called in all the armed forces chiefs and asked them to outline their priority needs. Based on that, we work to secure sufficient funding to improve our defence machinery and assets,” he said.

LUMUT, June 15 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has expressed his satisfaction with the progress of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) construction by Lumut Naval Shipyard (Lunas) at the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) base here, describing it as commendable.
  He said the progress demonstrated the government’s strong commitment to prioritising national security assets and reflected the Madani government’s emphasis on good governance.
  “We regard the RMN as a key line of defence, as our waters are not immune to threats such as terrorism, potential foreign incursions and smuggling. That is why I agreed for the LCS project to continue under the Finance Ministry.
  “Previous delays stemmed from weak management, governance issues and corruption. If the management is poor, how can we ensure maritime security? That’s why good governance is essential,” he said in his speech at the Kenduri Rakyat programme held in conjunction with the Perak Madani Rakyat Programme 2025 at Shariff Hall, RMN Lumut here today.
  Also present was Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil.
  Earlier, the prime minister visited the Lunas facility at the RMN base to inspect the ongoing LCS construction works.
  Meanwhile, Anwar said the government remains attentive to the need to enhance the country’s defence assets, with the Defence Ministry being among the ministries receiving the largest allocations in the annual budget.
  “Defence ranks third (in terms of allocation), after education and health. For 2025 alone, RM21.2 billion has been allocated - a significant amount for a developing nation,” he said.
  He added that the move reflected the government’s appreciation of the sacrifices made by the security forces and was aimed at ensuring national stability, which is crucial for economic growth.
  Anwar also said he is often moved when learning of the poor condition of certain security assets that are still in use to safeguard the nation.
  “That’s why, upon the formation of the Madani Government, I called in all the armed forces chiefs and asked them to outline their priority needs. Based on that, we work to secure sufficient funding to improve our defence machinery and assets,” he said. — Bernama

鼓手们呈献气势磅礴的精彩表演。（陈文强摄）
（马六甲13日讯）马来西亚国家文化人物
陈再藩
表示，二
十四节令鼓
是马来西亚文化创新的重要成果，过去37年来不断发展壮大，不仅成为国家非物质文化遗产，也迈向联合国“人类非遗”的国际舞台，展现出大马华人对文化根脉的创造性守望。
他指出，二十四节令鼓创立于1988年，当年他与陈徽崇老师在新山将节气、书法与狮鼓融合，结合成这一独特的艺术形式；2008年，节令鼓被列为马来西亚第二项华族国家非遗。
ADVERTISEMENT
没固定鼓谱鼓励自由创作
陈再藩强调，节令鼓没有固定鼓谱，正因为如此，它鼓励年轻人自由创作、即兴发挥，成为传统文化中少有的“活体艺术”，这也是他始终坚持的理念：“传统文化要像江河奔流，而不是博物馆里的标本”，包括如今许多年轻女鼓手高喊“打鼓很帅”，足见节令鼓已成为新世代心中的文化摇滚。
陈再藩今日出席在马六甲文化及艺术局综合大厦举行的马来西亚二十四节令鼓37周年庆典时，这么表示。
他表示，节令鼓的国际传播是一部壮阔的民间史诗，1997年，马来西亚留学生将节令鼓带往中国，在华侨大学成立中国首支鼓队；2010年，美国俄克拉荷马大学鼓队登上NBA赛场演出；2012年伦敦奥运圣火传至利物浦，由利物浦大学节令鼓队迎接火炬。2022年，非洲鼓手身穿汉服击鼓表演，而2024年，马来西亚政府正式提名节令鼓申报联合国非物质文化遗产。相关成就被《亚洲周刊》形容为“文化反哺中华”，显示大马原创文化已具全球影响力。

全球节令鼓逾500支 鼓手逾6万
他说，据统计，目前全球已有超过500支节令鼓队、超过6万名鼓手，让节气文化成为跨越国界、跨越族群的共通语言。
他认为，节令鼓自创立以来始终扎根校园，是它得以传承和扩展的重要基础，2008年节令鼓被编入华小课本，多年来有数十万学生学会节气歌谣和鼓艺；他对此感到欣慰，并呼吁持续将节令鼓纳入教育体系中。
英歌舞与节令鼓跨界融合
他说，节令鼓艺术层面上不断演进与创新，显示出传统与现代的深度对话，并举例潮州汕头英歌舞与节令鼓跨界融合，衍生出“东方街舞”的崭新形式。
他指出，如今节令鼓已站在申遗的门槛前，从起初的一份节日热闹，发展为世界文明对话的一座桥梁。
“让传统活在当下而非封存在历史中、让青年主导传承、让马来西亚的创意为人类文明添彩，是我们共同努力的方向。”

吴圣雄：走向世界舞台奠基础
马来西亚二十四节令鼓协会会长吴圣雄表示，今年是节令鼓创立以来首次在吉隆坡与新山以外的城市举办周年庆典，选择马六甲，象征节令鼓文化正走向全国、迈向世界，也因马六甲是我国文化遗产重镇。
他说，今年庆典主题为《蓄势待发》，体现了积蓄能量、奋起腾飞的决心，也呼应协会明年向联合国教科文组织申请将节令鼓列入非物质文化遗产名录的目标，是为后代保留文化的重要一步。
他强调，不论是比赛制度、纳入教育或文化推广，协会每一步都在为走向世界舞台奠定基础。
与《又见马六甲》签备忘录
他说，协会今日与《又见马六甲》签署文化策略伙伴合作备忘录，成为文化发展的重要起点，双方将持续协商推动更多具体项目，并相信透过跨界合作、资源整合，节令鼓将成为马来西亚对外文化交流的亮丽名片。
吴圣雄也指出，协会过去在全国各地成功举办区域赛及第六届国际节令鼓节暨马来西亚精英赛，发掘无数鼓艺新星，并把这项本土文化带入更多社区、学校和国人心中。
他感谢教育部副部长黄家和及教育部的大力支持，让节令鼓逐步纳入学校课外活动体系，落实组织多年来的努力与愿景，也感谢老师、家长与鼓艺前辈的奉献，让节令鼓不再是少数学校的特色，而是全国学校皆可参与、传承的文化遗产。
房有平：新山甲结深厚文化缘份
马六甲大会堂主席房有平表示，在36年里，马六甲标志了二十四节令鼓发展的2个重要里程碑，即36年前是随文化节从新山来到马六甲而迈向全国；如今是从国家非物质文化遗产迈向联合国教科文人类非遗，同时也在马六甲启动筹备明年申遗的首次工作会议。
他指出，1989年，马六甲轮值举办第六届全国华人文化节并首次在三保山举行文化节火炬点燃仪式，来自新山的陈再藩与陈徽崇老师亲自率领刚满一周岁的宽柔中学二十四节令鼓队及合唱团，于升旗仪式上擂响二十四节令鼓及演唱《传灯》歌曲，使这两项从南方传来的鼓乐与文化歌曲从此成为华人文化节的核心节目，年年随着文化节轮转各州并传播全国，新山也与马六甲结下深厚的文化缘份。
“36年前，陈再藩先生36岁，全国只有一支宽中节令鼓队。如今陈先生72岁，节令鼓不但是国家非物质文化遗产，还传遍全球5大洲，队伍多达600支。今日在马六甲庆祝成立37周年，对马六甲而言是文化上的故人归来。”
何朝东：期待成为世界性文化
新山中华公会会长何朝东表示，虽然柔佛以创造节令鼓和高桩舞狮为光荣，但继它们陆续成为我国非遗文化后，就已经是全马人的文化，未来若能被列入联合国教科文组织非遗名录，则成为世界性文化，令人期待。
他希望在各界的协助下，柔佛古庙夜游、二十四节令鼓及高桩舞狮，很快能成为联合国教科文组织非遗文化。
出席嘉宾有教育部副部长黄家和、旅游、艺术与文化部国家文物遗产局局长杨玲燕博士、《又见马六甲》创办人兼永大集团主席拿督威拉巫光伦、总经理雷鹏、马来西亚侨生公会会长拿督颜泳和及马来西亚二十四节令鼓协会署理会长郑洲升等。

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba heads to Canada on Sunday for trade talks with U.S. President Donald Trump, hoping to persuade him to drop trade tariffs that have imperilled Japan's auto companies and threaten to undermine his fragile government.
  The two are expected to meet on the sidelines of a summit of the Group of Seven nations in Kananaskis, Alberta, for their second in-person encounter. It follows a sixth round of high-level trade talks in Washington on Friday.
  Japan's top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said he explored the possibility of an deal in detailed meetings with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
  The trick for Ishiba, who spoke with Trump by phone on Friday, will be to get the president to drop the 25% tariff he imposed on Japanese cars, as well as a paused 24% across-the-board levy that Trump calls a reciprocal tariff, without making concessions that could hurt the prime minister's public support at home.
  Returning to Tokyo with no deal would be better politically than conceding too much, analysts say.
  "If it goes badly, it could even be seen as a positive for Ishiba, standing up to Trump and standing up for his country when he's under assault," said Michael Cucek, a political science professor at Temple University in Tokyo. 
  Ishiba and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party face an upper house election next month that comes after a lower house loss in November that left him reliant on the support of other parties to stay in power. Another poor electoral result could bring down his government and would force Trump to reset trade talks with a new Japanese administration.
  "The most important thing is that Ishiba does not cave in for a bad (auto) deal," said Joseph Kraft, a financial political analyst at Rorschach Advisory in Tokyo. "I expect there will be some kind of deal, although it could be haphazard. Trump needs some good news and I don't think he has much interest in G7 activities."
  Failing to reach an agreement in Canada might not have an immediate economic impact on Japan, but tariffs that stay in place will eventually drag down growth, said Asuka Tatebayashi, senior analyst at Mizuho Bank.
  "If you look at the data for car exports to the U.S. for April, it was quite striking. The volume in dollars was down by nearly 5%, but the number of cars has increased a lot," she said.
  "It means either they are only selling cheap cars or the manufacturers are absorbing the cost. I think the latter is the case and this is not very sustainable."
  Tariffs could shave 0.9% off Japan's gross domestic product, Mizuho Research & Technologies estimated in a report in April.

TOKYO, June 15 — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba heads to Canada today for trade talks with US President Donald Trump, hoping to persuade him to drop trade tariffs that have imperilled Japan’s auto companies and threaten to undermine his fragile government.
  The two are expected to meet on the sidelines of a summit of the Group of Seven nations in Kananaskis, Alberta, for their second in-person encounter. It follows a sixth round of high-level trade talks in Washington on Friday.
  Japan’s top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said he explored the possibility of a deal in detailed meetings with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
  The trick for Ishiba, who spoke with Trump by phone on Friday, will be to get the president to drop the 25 per cent tariff he imposed on Japanese cars, as well as a paused 24 per cent across-the-board levy that Trump calls a reciprocal tariff, without making concessions that could hurt the prime minister’s public support at home.

JAKARTA: Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin is considering popular tourist destinations such as Bali and Labuan Bajo in East Nusa Tenggara as strategic locations to develop Indonesia’s medical tourism industry, amid efforts to reduce the number of citizens seeking medical treatment abroad.
  Budi said that each year, an estimated one to two million Indonesians travel abroad for medical treatment, primarily to Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the United States.
  “Indonesia loses approximately Rp 163 trillion [US$10 billion] annually in capital outflow, equivalent to nearly one per cent of the country’s gross domestic product [GDP] last year,” he said on Thursday (June 12) as quoted by Kompas.
  Budi said the massive capital outflow underscores the urgent need to develop high-quality medical tourism within Indonesia, particularly in popular destinations such as Bali and Labuan Bajo, to encourage citizens to seek treatment at domestic healthcare facilities.
  “This way, people can spend their money not only on enjoying the beach, art or culture during their vacation, but also on accessing quality healthcare services. Such a strategy could also help attract international travelers to participate in Indonesia’s medical tourism,” he said.
  The Health Ministry estimates that Indonesia’s medical tourism sector has the potential to contribute up to Rp 1.36 trillion to the national GDP annually, a figure expected to rise in line with increasing life expectancy and the country’s growing aging population.
  According to Budi, this potential could boost Indonesia’s current GDP by approximately 6 percent. The government is currently developing two Special Economic Zones (SEZs) focused on tourism and healthcare, the Sanur SEZ in Bali and the Batam SEZ in Riau Islands, as part of efforts to boost the country's medical tourism industry.
  The Sanur SEZ will become Indonesia’s first integrated medical tourism complex and, according to the government, the first and largest of its kind in Asia. The facility will feature hospitals, specialist clinics, medical research centres, hotels and convention centres. It is scheduled to launch later this month.
  The government has collaborated with leading medical institutions from Germany, Japan and the US to establish a centre of excellence within the Sanur SEZ. The complex will be managed by state-owned tourism company InJourney and is projected to generate Rp 20 trillion in state revenue by 2045.
  The Batam SEZ will span approximately 47 hectares and will include a hospital, nursing academy, convention hall, doctors’ housing and dormitories, hotels, shops, cottages, bungalows, a retirement village and a clinic.
  The complex, to be managed by the Batam Development Agency (BP Batam), is expected to open in 2026 and aims to attract Rp 6.91 trillion in investment by 2032. Apollo Hospitals, the largest private healthcare provider in India, is the main investor in the project.
  According to BP Batam, the company is renowned for delivering international-quality medical care at competitive prices, with specialties in oncology, cardiology, neurology and robotic-assisted surgeries.
  Besides developing SEZs, the government is also working to increase the number of medical specialists in the country to reduce outbound medical tourism. To achieve this goal, the government has recently introduced hospital-based residency programmes, expanded scholarships for medical specialist training and streamlined the doctor licensing process.
  Indonesia has among the lowest number of doctors per capita in the world, with 0.47 general physicians and 0.19 medical specialists for every 1,000 people. Making matters worse, some 67 per cent of the nation’s specialists practice in Java or Bali, with higher concentrations in hospitals in major cities, which can offer bigger paychecks.
  As of April, around 34 per cent of regional general hospitals (RSUD) nationwide could not fulfill the government’s minimum of seven types of medical specialists: Pediatricians, obstetrician/gynecologists, surgeons, internists, anesthesiologists, radiologists and clinical pathologists. - The Jakarta Post/ANN

阿尔巴尼斯表示，将在加拿大举行的七大工业国家（G7）峰会和
美国总统
特朗普
会面，讨论澳英美三方安全伙伴关系（AUKUS）防御协议和关税问题，这是这两位领袖首次的面对面会谈。
阿尔巴尼斯之前表示，期待与特朗普“面对面”会谈，但是并未透露具体时间。

他表示，17日将在
G7峰会
场边和特朗普会面。
G7峰会将于15日至17日在加拿大举行。
根据官方纪录，阿尔巴尼斯周六在西雅图表示，他们确实进行了会谈安排。特朗普目前在处理一些议题，他预期双方将能进行一场具建设性的接触。
阿尔巴尼斯说：“显然地，我们将提起关税问题，提起AUKUS的重要性，而且我们将像两个朋友该有的样子来进行讨论。”
华盛顿要求堪培拉把国防支出在GDP的占比从2%提高到3.5%，预料也是这次会谈的议题。

The Aukus deal aims to arm Australia with a fleet of cutting-edge, nuclear-powered submarines. (EPA Images pic)
SYDNEY
:
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he will meet with US President Donald Trump at next week’s G7 meeting in Canada where he plans to discuss trade tariffs and a defence pact put under review by Washington.
The G7 summit starting today in the Canadian Rockies town of Kananaskis marks the first major global gathering of Trump’s second term.
“We do have a meeting scheduled,” Albanese told reporters, adding that he expected “a constructive engagement”.
“We’ll raise tariffs, we’ll raise the importance as well of Aukus, and we will have a discussion as two friends should,” he said from Seattle, as he makes his way to the G7 summit.
The 2021 Aukus deal joins Australia, the UK and the US in a multi-decade effort to balance China’s growing military might.
The deal aims to arm Australia with a fleet of cutting-edge, nuclear-powered submarines from the US and provides for cooperation in developing an array of warfare technologies.
The Trump administration put the pact under review last week, but Australian officials said it was “perfectly natural for an incoming administration to do”.
“The context of the Aukus discussions will be what Australia contributes, the potential that Aukus has to allow for a range of benefits to the US,” he said.
Australia, a close US ally, has been slugged with a blanket 10% tariff on goods exported to the US – rising to 50% on steel and aluminium – as part of Trump’s sweeping global duties
“I will put forward Australia’s interests respectfully, because it is also in the interest of the US for Australia to be treated appropriately,” Albanese said.

(Reuters) -Players cannot pick and choose which games they will be available for, United States coach Mauricio Pochettino said after forward Christian Pulisic skipped the CONCACAF Gold Cup but offered to play in a pair of friendlies.
  Pulisic, who played 50 games for AC Milan in the recently-concluded season, said he would miss the Gold Cup to rest and recover, with former U.S. stalwarts Landon Donovan and Alexi Lalas among those who criticised the decision.
  In an interview with the CBS Sports podcast on Thursday, Pulisic said he had asked to play in friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, but was not involved in those matches because Pochettino wanted a consistent squad heading into the Gold Cup.
  The AC Milan winger said he understood the head coach's decision, while adding that those questioning his commitment to the national team were "way out of line".
  Asked about Pulisic's comments, Pochettino told reporters on Saturday: "Players (do) not need to understand or not understand. Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan. 
  "Because if not, OK, we invert — we swap the position (coach and player), no ? That is obvious. The most important thing is that we explain why we decided not to include (him) in the two friendly games. 
  "And then if you have some problems, no, that is not my problem to understand... I am the head coach. I am not a mannequin."
  The U.S. suffered defeats in both of their friendly matches, losing 2-1 to Turkey and 4-0 at home against Switzerland.
  They will look to snap a four-game losing run when they begin their Gold Cup campaign with a match against Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose, California later on Sunday.

SAN FRANCISCO, June 15 — United States coach Mauricio Pochettino defended his decision to omit Christian Pulisic from recent friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland yesterday, saying he alone was responsible for choosing his squad.
  AC Milan star Pulisic has been at the center of a simmering controversy over his request to be excused from US duty in the Concacaf Gold Cup, which kicked off yesterday.
  Former US international players including Landon Donovan have criticised Pulisic’s decision, questioning his commitment to representing the United States.
  Pulisic hit back at his critics on Thursday, revealing that while he had asked to skip the Gold Cup, he had been willing to play in the warm-up games — only to be denied by Pochettino.
  The winger said that he had accepted Pochettino’s decision but did not “understand” it.
  Asked about his decision to leave out Pulisic yesterday, Pochettino said it was not for players to pick and choose which games they wanted to play in.
  “He explained why he only wanted to be involved in two games,” Pochettino said of Pulisic. “And I respect and I understand him. I understand him. But I don’t need for him to understand our decision. Because my position is, I am 53 with a lot of experience in football.”
  “If he performs well and he is the best, it’s normal he’s going to have a place in the national team.
  “It’s not because a player [is saying]: ‘I want to play.’ ‘I want this.’ ‘I want that.’ I signed my contract with the federation and I am the head coach — I am not a mannequin.”

HANOI: Vietnam's National Assembly on Saturday (June 14) approved a proposal to raise the special consumption tax on alcoholic beverages to 90 per cent by 2031 from the current 65 per cent, a move that will add to challenges facing the industry even though the top rate won't be as high as first flagged.
  Under the legislation, the tax rate on beer and strong liquor will rise to 70 per cent by 2027, a year later than initially proposed, before reaching 90 per cent in 2031.
  Vietnam currently imposes a 65 per cent tax on these products and the initial proposal last year had the tax rising to as high as 100 per cent.
  The finance ministry has said the aim of the higher taxes is to curb alcohol consumption. Vietnam is South-East Asia's second-largest beer market, according to a report by consultancy KPMG in 2024.
  Vietnam's beer industry, led by Dutch brewer Heineken, Denmark's Carlsberg, and local brewers Sabeco and Habeco, has already faced challenges from stringent drink-driving laws introduced in 2019, which set a zero-alcohol limit for drivers.
  The country's Beer and Alcoholic Beverage Association chief has said industry revenue has declined for the past three years.
  In response to weakening demand and the initial proposal for the tax hike, Heineken last year suspended operations at one of its Vietnam breweries.
  On Saturday, the lawmakers also approved a new levy of eight per cent on sugary drinks exceeding 5g/100ml of sugar that will take effect in 2027 and rise to ten per cent in 2028. - Reuters

WASHINGTON, June 14 (Reuters) --Authorities on Saturday asked residents of two Minneapolis suburbs to stay indoors as they searched for a suspect posing as a police officer who shot two Democratic state lawmakers and their spouses in their homes, according to local media reports.
Those targeted in the pre-dawn attacks were identified in the reports as state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, of Champlin, and state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, of Brooklyn Park.
The conditions of the victims were not immediately known.

Amy Klobuchar, one of Minnesota's USsenators, confirmed the identities of the victims of the "stunning act of violence" in a post on X, saying her prayers "are with the Hortman and Hoffman families. Both legislators are close friends and devoted to their families and public service."
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will speak to reporters shortly to "address violence targeted at legislators," his office said.
Walzsaid in a post on X that he was "briefed this morning on an ongoing situation involving targeted shootings in Champlin and Brooklyn Park. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety and local law enforcement are on the scene."
In a later post, Walz said he had activated Minnesota'sEmergency Operations Centreand was providing the police in the two suburbs "the full resources" of the state.

WASHINGTON, June 15 — A manhunt was underway yesterday for a gunman who shot two Democratic state lawmakers in Minnesota, killing one and her husband and wounding the other, in what the northern US state’s governor said were politically motivated attacks.
The shootings came as deep political divisions have riven the United States, the same day that tens of thousands of protestors across the country took to the streets against the policies of Republican President Donald Trump.

Authorities named the assailant as 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, who was still at large and considered “armed and dangerous.”
“We believe he’s working to potentially flee the (Minneapolis-St Paul) area,” said Drew Evans, superintendent of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, at a press conference.

Boelter had been spotted Saturday morning in the Minneapolis area on video surveillance footage obtained from a business, the official said.

Evans said authorities were still investigating the suspect’s motives, and did not know if additional people were involved in the attacks.
Trump and US Attorney General Pam Bondi decried what they called “horrific violence” and said perpetrators would be prosecuted to “the fullest extent of the law.”

‘Targeted political violence’ 
State Representative Melissa Hortman — the former speaker — and her husband Mark were killed at their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park, Governor Tim Walz told an earlier press conference.
State Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were shot and wounded at their home in nearby Champlin, the governor said, his voice breaking with emotion.
“This was an act of targeted political violence,” Walz told reporters. “Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint.”
Evans said Hoffman was out of surgery and “in stable condition” but that he had suffered “significant injuries.”
The state official said Hoffman and his wife were shot first, and as police investigated, Hortman and her husband were shot about 90 minutes later.
The gunman was able to escape during an exchange of fire with officers near Hortman’s residence, Evans said.
Praetorian Guards Security Services, a home security company, described Boelter on its website as its director of security patrols.

Impersonating law enforcement 
In both attacks, authorities believe the assailant was impersonating a law enforcement officer.
An anti-Trump rally in Minneapolis — part of the national wave of “No Kings” protests planned for yesterday — was cancelled after police issued a shelter-in-place order because of the shootings.
Flyers for the protests were found in the suspect’s car, as well as a manifesto that named numerous politicians and state officials, police said.
Tensions were high across the country, and in Texas authorities said they evacuated the state capitol complex after a “credible threat towards state lawmakers planning to attend a protest later today.”
In Brooklyn Park, where Hortman lived, authorities lifted a shelter-in-place order yesterday afternoon, saying that while the suspect remained at large, there was “reason to believe he is no longer in the area.”
The United States has been deeply divided since Trump returned to the White House in January.
The Republican president has drawn criticism from Democrats over his harsh immigration policy, his assault on universities and the media and a perceived flouting of limits on executive power as he pushes his agenda.
“At this precipice moment we’re on, this tragic act here in Minnesota should serve as a reminder to all of us,” Walz said.
“The democracy and the debates in the halls of Congress, in state houses, in school boards, is a way to settle our differences peacefully and move society to a better place.”
US Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota remembered Hortman as a friend who dedicated her life to serving the state, working on issues such as women’s rights and clean energy.
Former US congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived a shooting to the head in 2011 and is now a prominent advocate for the prevention of gun violence, described herself as “devastated” by Hortman’s death.
“We must protect our democracy from those who try to destroy it with a gun,” Giffords wrote on X. — AFP

多项科学研究指出，香水中的某些成分，与荷尔蒙失调之间存在关联。其中最常被提及的化学物质之一是邻苯二甲酸酯（phthalates），这种物质常用于延长香味的停留时间，并让香水更容易附着在皮肤或布料上。（网络示意图）
（吉隆坡15日讯）许多民众尤其女性都喜欢喷
香水
，然而香水里面一些成分恐干扰
荷尔蒙
平衡，长期使用的话可能会对健康带来影响。
根据女子努鲁阿紫雅通过账号@nurulaziahzaki分享到tiktok的视频，她透露自己曾因长期喷香水，导致荷尔蒙失调，身心健康受影响。

她坦言，自己过去对香水极为着迷，不仅每天使用，还将各种香氛视为收藏品。
“只要市面上有新款香水推出，我几乎都会买来尝试，并在日常生活中轮流使用。”
不过，她也透露，自己当时开始出现明显的荷尔蒙失调问题，包括月经周期紊乱、严重经痛，以及经前剧烈头痛等症状。
她坦言，自己当时并没有意识到，这些问题可能与她钟爱的香水有关。
“我后来才得知，香水中含有的某些成分会导致体内摄入‘类雌激素’（xenoestrogen），而这种物质可能在不知不觉中扰乱人体的荷尔蒙系统。”
自此之后，阿紫雅决定放弃使用一般香水，改为使用以花类为主、气味温和的精油，例如天竺葵（geranium）等。
经查证后，确实有多项科学研究指出，香水中的某些成分，与荷尔蒙失调之间存在关联。
其中最常被提及的化学物质之一是邻苯二甲酸酯（phthalates），这种物质常用于延长香味的停留时间，并让香水更容易附着在皮肤或布料上。
研究指出，邻苯二甲酸酯是一种内分泌干扰物（endocrine disruptor），可能对人体荷尔蒙系统造成干扰，包括打乱女性的月经周期、降低男性精子质量，以及导致雌激素与睾酮之间的荷尔蒙失衡等问题。
根据荷兰科学和医学书目数据库网站《Science Direct》于2017年的一项研究，暴露在高浓度邻苯二甲酸酯环境中的人士，其睾酮水平普遍偏低。
值得注意的是，人体并非只通过香水接触这类物质，其他常见日用品也可能含有类似成分，包括含香味的沐浴露或肥皂、室内香氛喷雾、气味浓郁的润肤乳液、衣物柔顺剂等等。
许多网民纷纷对此表示认同，并留言分享自己类似的经历。
有网民指出，自从迷上某品牌的香水后，开始出现莫名头痛、荷尔蒙型痘痘和月经周期紊乱等问题。
也有网民补充说，其实不只是香水，日常生活中接触的物品如衣物材质、沐浴露、洗发水、甚至衣物柔顺剂等，也可能含有干扰荷尔蒙的化学成分，长期接触或对身体造成潜在影响。

SANDAKAN: As Sabah gears up for its 17th state election, Sabah PAS finds itself at a political crossroads – a Perikatan Nasional component party in the Opposition at federal level, yet friendly with the ruling Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) coalition.
  However, Sabah PAS commissioner Datuk Dr Aliakbar Gulasan stressed that the party’s political direction remains with Perikatan.
  “As of now, I feel I’m still among those who are friendly with GRS because it is part of the government, and that’s based on the political history that began in 2020.
  "As for what will happen in the state election, if I look at the other parties, none of them have made a decision either.
  ALSO READ: Sabah PAS yet to finalise under which party logo to contest
  “Everyone is still looking for friends, coalitions, and so on. In the context of Sabah, I think what’s clear is that PAS remains within Perikatan. So any discussions are still centred on Perikatan,” he said after officiating the Karnival Keluarga Sandakan 2025 here on Saturday (June 14).
  Last month, PAS deputy president Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man said the party aimed to contest at least six seats in Sabah, possibly under a different logo as part of a broader coalition strategy.
  Aliakbar, however, said no specific number of seats has been decided, and the party has yet to begin formal negotiations with any potential allies.
  “For now, we are focused on strengthening our organisation within Perikatan,” he said.
  He also cautioned politicians against fanning regional sentiments ahead of the polls, warning that such rhetoric could threaten national unity.
  ALSO READ:  Sabah PAS ‘comfortable’ with GRS, says state commissioner
  “Sometimes, before elections, we act like there’s a separation between the peninsula, Sabah and Sarawak. If we keep stirring that, it could lead to bigger conflicts or long-term segregation,” he said.
  On candidates, Aliakbar said PAS intends to field credible and honest individuals with strong religious grounding and a clear understanding of the responsibility of leadership.
  “If politicians don’t understand the concept of sin and reward, they could fall into corruption or abuse of power,” he said.
  Although PAS has yet to win a seat in Sabah, the party will continue its community outreach and leave it to the public to evaluate its performance, Aliakbar said.
  His appointment as the first PAS-nominated assemblyman in Sabah in 2020 drew criticism from some state leaders and civil society groups, who viewed the party as too extreme for Sabah’s multireligious and culturally diverse landscape.
  ALSO READ:  Sabah PAS invites non-Muslims to join as associate members
  While concerns were raised about the potential impact on social harmony, PAS leaders sought to downplay the backlash, stressing that their priority in Sabah was service and inclusivity.
  Despite the early controversy, Aliakbar has remained the party’s sole nominated assemblyman and continues to openly support the GRS-led state government.
  PAS became part of the Sabah government following the 2020 state election, when Perikatan aligned with GRS and Barisan Nasional to form the state administration after defeating Parti Warisan.
  In 2022, following the 15th General Election, Perikatan became the federal Opposition.
  Its position in Sabah also shifted after Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor and several state leaders left Bersatu.
  
------------------------------
KOTA KINABALU: Sabah Barisan Nasional and Umno will not wait for a green light from any external parties to declare their position or chart their political course, says Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin (pic ).
  The state Barisan and Umno chief said the coalition will contest the upcoming 17th state election on its own strengths.
  While Sabah Barisan does not reject political cooperation, he said, it will not be part of an alliance just to "make up the numbers" or legitimise a fragile grip on power.
  ALSO READ: GRS grassroots want straight fight with Barisan in Sabah polls, claims Armizan
  Ruling coalition Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) deputy secretary-general Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali had recently called for straight fights in the upcoming state polls.
  In a statement on Sunday (June 15), Bung Moktar also said friendships and partnerships should be built on sincerity, going beyond agreements on paper and extending to policy implementation, respect for allies, and upholding the integrity of the political system.
  “Political cooperation without honesty is like building a house on mud … it may stand for a while, but will surely collapse when tested.
  “Sabah Barisan will no longer build on mud. We have learned our lesson. The people have also seen how insincere alliances result in weak, inconsistent and untrustworthy governments,” he said.
  Bung Moktar added that Barisan welcomes any democratic contest, for as long as it is grounded in genuine competition, not “borrowed support or shortcut formulas".
  ALSO READ: Sabah polls: Coalition partners should choose friendly contests over friction in seats where they overlap, says Salleh
  Directing his message squarely at GRS, he stated: “If it is sincere about a democratic contest, Barisan is ready to face it in the elections.”
  He stressed that clashes should not be feared in a democracy, but embraced as the best platform to test who truly commands public trust.
  “To the people of Sabah, especially the younger generation and the politically aware middle class, this is the time to reassess the political landscape and the choices before you.
  “Sabah Barisan does not come with mere slogans, but with a proven track record.
  "We have led this state towards development. We have been tested. And now, we return with a firm resolve to improve, not simply to repeat.
  “In political science, legitimacy does not come from seat numbers alone, but from the people’s trust in the sincerity of your struggle,” he added.
  ALSO READ: Sabah parties gear up for polls 
  Armizan had earlier said GRS grassroots members favour a direct contest against Barisan in the coming election, believing it would give voters a clearer choice and remove claims that a party won only because of another’s support.
  While supporting Bung Moktar’s call for the coalitions to go their separate ways, Armizan clarified that it was his personal opinion, not GRS’ official position.
  He also reiterated that GRS remains open to continued cooperation with Sabah Pakatan Harapan, aligning with the stand of Chief Minister and GRS chairman Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor.
  Armizan stressed that any electoral arrangement must also consider the interests of the current state government, not just the federal coalition.

Sabah chief minister and GRS chairman Hajiji Noor said the people want local parties to lead the government.
PETALING JAYA
:
Sabah chief minister Hajiji Noor said local parties must be dominant in Sabah politics and prioritised when forming alliances for the 17th state election
He said the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah government, which is formed by local parties, must be defended and continued in the upcoming election.
“We want to continue this government, and that is why this election is important. We must not make the wrong choice. Local parties must be dominant in Sabah’s political landscape and must be prioritised,” he said at the United Sabah National Organisation (Usno) annual congress in Kota Belud today.
Hajiji said any discussions on cooperation with other parties should not come at the expense of local leadership.
“Cooperation is another matter, but GRS as a local coalition must be defended. This aligns with the sentiment of the people on the ground who want local parties to lead the government.
“As GRS chairman, I will ensure this,” he said.
Hajiji said he would not hand over the rights and struggle of GRS to those with ill intentions.
“I will not easily surrender what GRS stands for to those trying to undermine the coalition,” he said.
He urged leaders and members of all GRS component parties, including Usno, to go to the ground and engage with the public on the coalition’s “Our Home, We Protect”, and “Sabah First” philosophies.
“This is our mission. When we say, ‘Our Home, We Protect’, it should be understood clearly. We shouldn’t have to explain bit by bit. It’s simple, we take care of our own,” he said.
Yesterday, Sabah PH chief Mustapha Sakmud said official negotiations with GRS were set to begin ahead of the state election, following approval from the PKR and PH central leadership.
However, GRS deputy secretary-general Armizan Mohd Ali said the coalition should “honour” Sabah Umno chief Bung Moktar Radin’s call for it to contest against BN in the polls before discussions on any possible cooperation.
------------------------------
KOTA BELUD, June 15 — Chief Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Hajiji Noor has emphasised that local parties must remain dominant in Sabah’s political landscape and be prioritised when forming alliances for the upcoming 17th State Election (PRN17).
  He said the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS)-led government, which was established by local parties, must be preserved, making the upcoming election especially crucial for the coalition.
  “We want to continue this government, and that is why I believe this election is extremely important. We must not make the wrong choice. Local parties must be dominant in Sabah’s politics and must be prioritised.
  “As for political cooperation, that’s another matter. But GRS, as a local coalition, is vital for us to defend, in line with grassroots sentiment that wants local parties to lead the government,” said Hajiji who is GRS chairman.
  “As chairman of GRS, I will ensure this happens,” he said when officiating United Sabah National Organisation (Usno) general congress at Dewan Terbuka Seri Dungkuan, Kampung Rampayan Laut, near here on Sunday.
  Hajiji said he would not easily surrender GRS’s rights and struggle to those attempting to undermine the coalition.
  As such, he expressed hope that all leaders and members of GRS component parties, including Usno, would go to the ground and explain to the people the essence of GRS’s struggle, which upholds the philosophies of ‘Rumah Kita, Kita Jaga’ and “Sabah First.”
  “This is the mission of our struggle in GRS. When we say ‘Rumah Kita, Kita Jaga’, people should understand there’s no need to explain every detail, it’s simple.
  “We must protect our home and avoid internal conflicts. If we fight, others will benefit, and we will lose. So, don’t quarrel. What’s important is that we win the election so we can continue this struggle, help the people, and develop our state,” he said.
  Hajiji emphasised that Usno and other component parties within GRS hold equally important roles within the coalition.
  “Therefore, I hope Usno, along with its entire leadership and supporters, will unite and give their full effort to ensure GRS wins in the upcoming election.
  “That’s why Usno’s participation in GRS is extremely important. Not only Usno, but all component parties in GRS play a crucial role in strengthening the coalition, especially with the election just around the corner.
  “Usno must channel its energy together with GRS so that we can regain the people’s mandate. When we formed GRS, we invited the current component parties to join us in defending Sabah’s rights.
  “Our intention is sincere and noble, as Sabahans, we must defend our rights as Sabahans. We must be united,” he said.
  He added that if only one party were to carry the struggle alone, it would not be able to shoulder such a major task. For that reason, GRS needs all its partners to fulfil the same responsibility, regardless of the party’s size.
  “We want to champion the plight of our people who are still left behind and in need of support. We want to uplift the standard of living for those still struggling.
  “We want to boost infrastructure and economic development in Sabah which is why, in my view, GRS, as the current government, must be given the mandate once again to govern Sabah after the election,” he said.
  In his speech, Hajiji also expressed appreciation for Usno’s commitment to GRS, reflected in its slogan ‘Usno dan GRS berpisah tiada’ as declared by its president, Tan Sri Pandikar Amin Mulia. — The Borneo Post

KOTA KINABALU, June 15 — Sabah Umno has welcomed Gabungan Rakyat Sabah’s (GRS) readiness to contest in the upcoming 17th State Election (PRN17), but stressed that any political cooperation must be grounded in sincerity, mutual respect, and shared values — not convenience or a mere hunger for power.
  Sabah Umno chairman Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin, responding to recent remarks by GRS deputy secretary-general Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali, said such statements were part of the democratic competition between parties operating in the same political space.
  “In principle, this is nothing extraordinary. In fact, it reflects a healthy democracy, where ideas and policies are tested in the open,” Bung Moktar said in a statement on Sunday.
  However, he firmly asserted that Umno and Barisan Nasional (BN) Sabah would not shape their political direction based on cues from others, nor would they wait for a “green light” to determine their next move.
  “Any cooperation must be evaluated through a broader lens — political legitimacy, strategic autonomy, and, most importantly, sincerity in partnership,” he said.
  He emphasized that BN remains open to cooperation, but only with allies who are genuinely committed — not only in signing agreements, but in respecting their partners and delivering on shared policies.
  “BN will not collaborate merely to strengthen numbers or support a fragile grip on power. Partnerships built on paper but lacking real trust and action are like houses built on mud — they might stand briefly, but they collapse under pressure,” he said.
  He added that the coalition had learned from past experiences, which showed that alliances without true intent only lead to weak, inconsistent, and untrustworthy governments.
  Commenting on the challenge posed by GRS, Bung Moktar said Sabah Umno is prepared to face it head-on through democratic means.
  “If GRS is ready, we welcome the contest. Democracy thrives on competition. Let the people decide who truly deserves their trust — not through borrowed support or shortcuts, but through proven strength and sincerity,” he said.
  He also called on Sabahans — particularly the youth and politically conscious middle class — to re-evaluate the political choices before them.
  “BN Sabah returns not with empty slogans, but with a tested record. We have governed, we have been tested, and now we return with a renewed resolve — not to repeat the past, but to do better,” he said.
  “Ultimately, political legitimacy does not lie solely in seat counts. It lies in the people’s belief in the sincerity of our struggle,” he concluded.
  Armizan has called for GRS to face off against BN in the upcoming state election.
  The Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister said a direct contest would allow voters to decide who should govern Sabah, aligning with Bung Moktar’s preference for BN and Pakatan Harapan (PH) to compete without GRS.
  “Everyone must respect Bung Moktar’s stance. No one should dismiss his autonomy as Sabah Umno chief,” Armizan said in a statement on Saturday. — The Borneo Post

KUALA LUMPUR: Pelakon, Kamal Adli, 39, menasihatkan kepada pendatang baharu dunia lakonan agar tidak membudayakan sikap kerap bermain telefon atau media sosial ketika bekerja.
  Katanya, sikap tersebut mencerminkan sisi tidak profesional mereka selain menyusahkan pelakon lain di set penggambaran.
  “Saya sebenarnya gembira kerana ramai juga ‘budak baharu’ yang tidak sombong dan berkawan dengan semua orang di set penggambaran.
  “Tetapi sampai juga ke telinga saya yang kononnya ada juga pelakon baharu yang tak buat persediaan dan selalu bermain telefon di set penggambaran.
  “Saya pun tertanya-tanya sejauh mana seriusnya mereka dalam bidang ini. Mereka ini benar-benar mahu jadi pelakon? Atau sekadar mahu dapatkan wang tambahan dengan berlakon?” katanya.
  Kamal berkata demikian pada sesi tayangan episod pertama drama Hilang Kasyorga terbitan Country & Universal Sdn. Bhd.
  Drama untuk tayangan saluran DEGUP, Unifi TV itu turut membariskan pelakon hebat antaranya Ellie Suriaty, Azhar Sulaiman, Nabila Huda, Luqman Hafiz, Fadilah Mansor, Kodi Rashid dan ramai lagi.
  Mengulas lanjut, Kamal berharap pelakon baharu faham bahawa bidang drama dan perfileman adalah industri yang serius membabitkan pelaburan yang besar.
  “Pelakon-pelakon baharu yang tidak serius ini perlu mencontohi sikap serius pelakon senior yang kalau bekerja, telefon pun mereka tak pegang.
  “Lakonan ini bidang profesional, yang patut masuk industri ini adalah mereka yang benar-benar bersedia dan faham kerja mereka.
  “Tapi ada sebilangan pelakon baharu tak bersikap begitu. Tak tahulah, mungkin mereka anggap berlakon ini kerja separuh masa sahaja,” kongsinya. – UTUSAN

KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 — Tech titan Microsoft has reaffirmed its commitment to invest RM10.5 billion in Malaysia, including the development of hyperscale data centres in the Klang Valley.
  This comes despite reports that the company has paused or delayed similar projects in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Indonesia.
  “Microsoft remains committed to our investment in Malaysia to accelerate the nation’s AI and cloud adoption,” a representative for Microsoft Malaysia told news portal Free Malaysia Today (FMT).
  “As a company, the tariff is something we are watching, but we don’t have anything to share right now,” the same unnamed source was quoted as saying, referring to market concerns triggered by US tariffs announced in April.
  In the same month, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft was scaling back plans for its US data centres in Illinois, North Dakota and Wisconsin, as well as in other countries.
  The company said these changes reflect the flexibility of its global infrastructure strategy.
  Last month, Microsoft launched its Malaysia West cloud region in Greater Kuala Lumpur, which includes three availability zones.
  The facility is expected to offer low-latency connectivity and a resilient digital infrastructure supporting services like Microsoft 365 and Azure.
  Microsoft is also pushing forward with its AI for Malaysia’s Future (AIForMYFuture) initiative to develop local talent.
  Its managing director Laurence Si previously said the company aims to train 800,000 Malaysians in artificial intelligence by the end of 2025.
  As of May, more than 400,000 people have already received AI training through the programme, Microsoft Malaysia’s legal and government affairs director Adilah Junid told FMT.
  She encouraged Malaysians to take part via Microsoft’s AI Skills Navigator website and the monthly AI Teach sessions at local institutions.
  “Microsoft relies heavily on local partners such as Biji-Biji, HRD Corp, Perkeso, Pepper Labs, and the International Women’s Federation of Commerce and Industry Malaysia,” Adilah was quoted as saying.
  “They are really the ones to have networks within the community and society, enabling us to make this opportunity as widely accessible as possible,” she added.
  Addressing environmental concerns, Adilah said Microsoft is exploring ways to make its data centre operations more sustainable.
  “We were part of the consultations with the digital ministry’s guidelines for sustainable data centres.
  “We also work with authorities to ensure that our water and energy usage metrics are aligned,” she was quoted as saying.

（浙江15日综合电）浙江近日爆出一起
霸王餐
纠纷，涉款高达人民币52万元（30.66万令吉）。
报道说，当地一名老板嫁女摆下252桌酒席，找来交情10多年的朋友采购婚宴食材，指定要有
东星斑
、
帝王蟹
，事后却嫌食材过贵， 以素质不好而拒绝付钱。

中媒《江南都市网》、《九派新闻》报道，浙江嘉兴桐乡猪肉商王师傅反映，早前受认识10多年的钱老板委托，找他为钱老板女儿婚宴采办食材。
王师傅说，钱老板当时说，要办252桌酒席，要求使用高级食材，比如东星斑、帝王蟹。只是婚宴完后，王师傅找钱老板要钱时却遭刁难，说他的海鲜食材总价52万元太高，怀疑王师傅“食水深”，要求对方按成本价加20元结算。

王师傅又说，钱老板又要求他提供海鲜供应商的成本价单据，然而王师傅因为海鲜入货价涉及商业机密而拒绝。
王师傅强调，已向钱老板出示所有采购单据，使用的食材也经钱老板方验收，没有所谓的“价格虚高，质量不达标”的问题，也说在这场婚宴采购中只赚了7000元（4126令吉）差价。
王师傅为了追回52万垫支的食材钱，多次联络钱老板，然而多次见不到人。
在另一厢，王师傅被欠天价食材费用事件曝光后，也有餐具供应商身现，指控钱老板同样拖欠6万元（3.53万令吉）餐具费。

浙江嘉兴电视台《小说新事》报道，媒体建议让钱老板把没有争议的部分，即先支付10多万的猪肉钱，可是钱老板同意后又反悔。
王师傅说，事件公开后，他按要求将海鲜采购原单拿去给钱老板，只是对方认为事件曝光后很丢脸，无法支付。目前王师傅已经请好律师，准备打官司讨钱。

李国成呼吁政府停止一切荒唐的开支，立即检讨所有出国拨款标准。

马哈迪
率团前往日本出席为期两天的日经论坛，质问“到底谁在勒紧裤带？是人民，还是你们这些口口声声改革的领袖？”
“这个国家，一个普通打工族一年的薪水可能都不到2万5000令吉，政府却能拨出近50万令吉给7个人出国两天？”
ADVERTISEMENT
李国成今日发表文告说，若按政府拨款计算，平均每人要花掉约6万9000令吉。就算加上一天前后往返、3天酒店住宿、商务舱机票、每日津贴加餐饮，也完全无法合理化这个天价数字。
“难道是住总统套房、吃蓝鳍金枪鱼、喝82年的红酒？不然怎么会一人6万9000？如果是小贩申请5000令吉创业基金，可能还要被问东问西、拖半年一年，政府这边拨几十万，却轻轻松松。”
他进一步批评政府一边高喊“减少浪费”、“为人民节流”，一边却毫不手软批准大笔政要出国费用，完全脱离人民现实，令人愤怒。
“我们已经看到太多自相矛盾的场景：小贩为了一桶煤气烦恼、农民为了柴油津贴排长龙，而领袖却拿着人民的钱，优雅地出国、坐头等舱，吃香喝辣，还说自己是‘深思熟虑’。”
他呼吁政府停止一切荒唐的开支，立即检讨所有出国拨款标准，并把眼光放回国内真正需要帮助的基层人民身上。

Arisprop Capital To Bring Aris Burger To China By 2027
By Mohd Noor Azeery Idris
KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 (Bernama) -- Frozen food manufacturer Arisprop Capital Bhd is planning to introduce its Aris Burger brand to the Chinese market by 2027, as part of the company’s global expansion strategy.
Its managing director, Datuk Haris Embong, said the company is currently focused on strengthening its domestic business foundations, including supply chain optimisation, product quality, and operational processes, before venturing internationally.
“We want to export our products overseas, possibly to China by 2027 or even earlier. But first, I want to reinforce our domestic foundation, as demand is high,” he said during Bernama TV’s “Bual Bisnes” programme yesterday.
The company is also planning a business visit to China as an initial step towards establishing export partnerships to support market expansion into the country.
In addition to China, Malaysian halal products are also attracting strong interest from other countries, including those in the Middle East, Japan, and Indonesia, Haris added.
To strengthen its product line-up, the company is currently in the final stages of developing a ready-to-eat (RTE) burger, which is expected to be the first of its kind in Malaysia.
“This ready-to-eat burger is the result of Arisprop’s research and innovation, and we anticipate strong demand in the local market,” he said.
All Aris Burger products have received the necessary certifications and approvals from agencies such as the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia, the Ministry of Health Malaysia, and the Department of Veterinary Services, positioning the company to compete on a global scale.

Some 27,000 fans roared as they chanted "J-Hope" over and over until the K-pop star finally appeared on stage at exactly 7pm, wearing sunglasses and a striking red outfit, for his encore solo concert "J-Hope Tour ‘Hope on the Stage’ Final" at Goyang Sports Complex, Gyeonggi Province, Friday.
  Marking the final stop of his world tour that began in end of February, J-Hope kicked off the show with four back-to-back tracks — What If, Pandora’s Box, Arson and Stop.
  "What’s up, Army (BTS’ fan name). What’s up, Goyang. Thank you so much to everyone who came to ‘Hope on the Stage Final,’" he said, greeting the crowd that filled the stadium.
  "This is it — the final show. I can’t believe it myself. Starting in Seoul at the end of February, this tour has lasted for three months and it’s finally come to an end. I’m honoured that the finale is happening on such a meaningful day — June 13," he said. BTS debuted on June 13, 2013.
  The golden maknae surprises Army 
  And meaningful it truly was.
  Following four songs from his special album Hope on the Street Vol. 1, J-Hope was joined on stage by none other than Jungkook, surprising fans who had anticipated the appearance of at least one BTS member.
  Four members — RM, V, Jimin and Jungkook — were recently discharged from their 18 months of mandatory military service.

  The stadium erupted in deafening cheers when the youngest member appeared and joined in singing I Wonder.
  "I was so nervous waiting under the stage. I’ve missed you all so much during the past year and a half," Jungkook said shyly, clearly not yet used to the crowd. "My brain kind of froze for a moment. It feels so surreal to be here. Memories are coming back, but it all feels so new. I’ve missed you so much. It’s such a joy to sing in front of you again."
  "I was watching Hobi (J-Hope’s nickname) backstage and he was so cool — he’s on a different level," Jungkook added, before performing Seven (feat. Latto) to give J-Hope time to prepare for the next segment.
  A bold new chapter: J-Hope's stage three 
  Stage 3 was all J-Hope. Of the four songs performed in this section, three were fresh singles — Killin’ It Girl (feat. GloRilla), Mona Lisa and Sweet Dreams (feat. Miguel) – FNZ Remix. Killin’ It Girl had just been released half a day earlier.
  "This one doesn’t need a long explanation," J-Hope said, referring to his latest single. "It’s a song that shows the sexy side of J-Hope. I released the three singles this year — all exploring love in my own way, made for easy listening. I wanted to give the songs a beginning, middle and end."
  Later, he fired up the crowd with a BTS medley including MIC Drop, Baepsae and Dis-ease, fueling anticipation for BTS’ eventual return to group activities.
  The final segments, titled "Fantasy and Wish", reflected J-Hope’s ideals and his hopes for happiness for everyone. The setlist included his Billboard Hot 100 debut track Chicken Noodle Soup (feat. Becky G), the B-side Hope World from his first mixtape, BTS’ beloved hit Spring Day, Equal Sign from Jack In The Box and Neuron, the main track of Hope on the Street Vol. 1.
  A show-stealing finale  
  But the true highlight of the night came in the encore — when Jin joined J-Hope on stage for a duet performance of Spring Day. He followed it up with a live rendition of his second solo EP’s main track, Don’t Say You Love Me.
  "Today is June 13 — our debut anniversary. I felt like I had to perform. So I just asked Hobi directly if I could do a stage with him. And here I am," Jin told fans.
  While only Jungkook and Jin appeared on stage, the rest of the BTS members were also present at the venue to support J-Hope. RM, V, Jimin and Suga were spotted in the VIP section and waved to fans when J-Hope mentioned them during his closing remarks.
  "Today is such a happy day — not just for me, but for all of our members," J-Hope said. "They came to support this concert. BTS members are so precious to me. Without them, there would be no me. And without all of you (Army), there would be no BTS.
  "As long as I can keep moving, I’ll show you the best performances and continue sharing good music with you. Thank you so much for coming."
  Goyang Sports Complex once again erupted with thunderous cheers from Army — a moment many will remember as the start of BTS’ next chapter.

It is 3.30pm at Cafe Bistrot David in Taman Tun Dr Ismail. The restaurant is closed for a short break and aside from the quiet chatter of the staff, it is near-silent.
  The calm is interrupted by the raucous, joyous laughter of children bursting through the doors of the eatery. “How dare you!” says six-year-old Hayley Chin loudly to her father, Brian Chin. Her face radiates indignation, her long hair swaying as she shakes her head with determination.
  Her eight-year-old brother, Brandon Chin, meanwhile, giggles along with his sister before flashing an irresistibly impish grin.
  Ever patient and indulgent, Brian gently settles his children at a table at the restaurant, unpacking a medley of colouring books and activity packs for his offspring to occupy themselves while he works.
  “No matter what, every day I try to spend at least one hour with my children. So sometimes they will come here or to Dave’s Deli and we’ll have tea time together or a meal together. Because that’s when we can really connect,” he says.
  Brian (right) often has his children Hayley and Brandon and his wife Honey come to one of his restaurants so they can all bond over a shared meal. — ART CHEN/The Star
  Brian is a seasoned F&B entrepreneur who manages a whole slew of restaurants in his family’s F&B empire, including Dave’s Deli and Café Bistrot David, to name a few. He is also a doting father to his two children and a devoted husband to his wife, Honey Leong.
  So just how does he manage it all? Well, it’s been quite the journey of discovery, he says.
  For many busy chefs and restaurant owners, juggling fatherhood and a restaurant career is no mean feat. The restaurant business is notorious for commanding long hours, which can regularly include 12-to-14-hour days. Chefs and restaurant owners also work most weekends and public holidays and rarely get much time off, which makes spending time with their families that much harder.
  And yet, many have found that with a little creativity and a whole lot of delegation, it can be done.
  Life before and after
  For many restaurateurs and chefs, life before and after having kids couldn’t be more different.
  Brian, for instance, grew up in the restaurant business (his father David Chin started Dave’s Deli when Brian was only three years old). And yet, when his own kids entered the picture, he had a hard time figuring out how to balance his career with the demands of fatherhood.
  “I didn’t see much of my parents when I was a kid. They worked hard and did the best that they could because they grew up poor. I grew up a bit more privileged because my parents built a good foundation.
  “And I was very close to my dad, I knew I wanted to be just like him and take over the business,” says Brian.
  Brian says that he has learnt not to micromanage so much and he now has trained and built a team that he trusts so that he can spend more time with his family. — ART CHEN/The Star
  When Brian married Leong, he says his goals and priorities were drastically different and centred around making more money.
  “I think before kids, we were living for ourselves, you know? It was just about our own happiness and chasing the money and success. But I think once Honey and I had kids, we kind of changed our priorities.
  “Now it's all about the kids. "Instead of just chasing the revenue and expansion and all that, I keep in mind how to balance my time with the kids as well,” he says.
  Brian says this change in mindset has everything to do with treasuring his own flesh and blood.
  “You know the saying – ‘You don’t know true love until you have kids?’ I tell everybody it’s so true because with these kids – it was just instant love. I would do anything for them,” he says passionately.
  Brian’s views are echoed by celebrated chef Shaun Ng of Michelin Selected Hide KL, who is the father of two-year-old Hayden Ng.
  “When I first started Hide a few years ago, I was the first one in and the last one to leave the restaurant. I was just there all the time because Hide was very, very new at that point, so I think at that infancy stage of things, it really required a lot more attention as well,” he says.
  Shaun (right) says his wife Leow has been instrumental in helping him to maintain his career as well as be a present father to his son Hayden. — SHAUN NG
  When his son was born, Shaun confesses that he discovered his priorities shifting.
  “When my son was a newborn and needed to go for doctor’s appointments and vaccinations, I would come in an hour or two later so I could go for the appointment and over time, that became the norm,” he says.
  Hide also closes two days a week now and Shaun says this has given him more opportunities to spend quality time with his child and his wife Gigi Leow.
  “Before we only had one day off and it was a struggle trying to figure out whether to rest or spend time with family. Now I have more time to do both,” he says.
  For experienced F&B entrepreneur Wong Yin How, who helms the Tinkerman Collective, which owns and operates restaurants like Vintry, Stoked and Proof, his restaurant career started when he was footloose and fancy-free and had all the hours in the day to work.
  “I entered the restaurant industry in 2004 before I got married and had kids. So the biggest difference was that my time was my own, so I was quite involved in the day-to-day running. When the kids came along, I had to find time to pop in and pop out,” he says.
  Yin How says his children are his trusted food advisers and the family typically bonds over holidays centred around food. Clockwise from left: Jen, Chan, Yin How and KJ at London's Borough Market. — WONG YIN HOW
  Yin How and his wife Chan Wen Dee are parents to Jen Wong, 14, and KJ Wong, 12. In the early years, Yin How says as a family they often weren’t able to get together on public holidays, special celebrations or weekends but over the years, they have figured out how to make it work.
  “We never really celebrate Father’s Day or Valentine’s Day or anything like that because that is when the restaurants are busiest, so now we have made it a tradition to celebrate on another day instead,” he says.
  Delegating work
  In order to carve out more time with their families, many F&B entrepreneurs have had to cast aside their need to do it all and share the workload with others instead.
  “I think the first few years after my son was born, it was a struggle because I wasn’t really around, as I didn’t know how to manage my workload. And of course it was hard on Honey because it was almost like she was a single mum.
  “But over time, I realised something had to change. So I started to build my team and I didn’t micromanage so much. I relied on my team more so that I could spend time with my family,” says Brian.
  Once he became a father, Shaun (left) said he learnt to delegate duties to his staff, which in turn has helped them develop and grow their own skills. — Hide KL/Instagram
  For Shaun, meanwhile, the birth of his child inevitably led to him organically trusting his team more.
  “If you are doing a lot, the team is not going to learn, because you are doing things for them already. So as a head chef – even if you are single – it is important to let go a little so that the team can learn and grow as well,” he says.
  Having said that, all the fathers agree that they couldn’t have found ways to keep their family lives together were it not for their spouses.
  “As a father, of course I have to make a lot of sacrifices, but my wife has to make a lot of sacrifices too. I’m sure everyone in the industry feels the same.
  “With my wife, it has taken a lot of compromise, understanding and sacrifices on her part to take the punches and go through the journey with me and help to motivate me and keep me going to pursue my dreams while holding our family together. She’s my rock,” says Shaun.

  Bonding over food
  If your father is a restaurant owner or a chef, the chances of you NOT being a foodie are slim to none. Which is why Brian, Shaun and Yin How all agree that food has helped them bond with their children in more ways than one.
  Brian, for instance, says that even though Brandon and Hayley are still little, they have developed very good palates and he trusts their opinions on food, which is why they come for some of the tastings at his restaurants.
  “Brandon’s favourite food is the Wagyu steak at his grandfather (David Chin’s) restaurant, so he has quite sophisticated taste buds for an eight-year-old.
  “So these little guys are my taste-testers, especially for Dave’s Deli, because it is a very family-friendly restaurant. So let’s say we introduce a pasta dish on the menu – if Brandon and Hayley like it, I know everyone will like it,” says Brian.
  Yin How runs a slew of restaurants like Proof, which has award-winning pizzas (pictured here) and says his children have been instrumental in tasting new additions on the menu and giving him suggestions and feedback. — Proof Pizza/Instagram
  Yin How, on the other hand, says his children have literally grown up in the womb of the different restaurants that he has built, which is why family time often means going to the restaurants to do tastings.
  “Because I am in the business, I do bring them along for tastings or to try special dishes and it has become a habit or ritual that they are one of the first few people to do pre-opening tastings when I open a new restaurant.
  "They both have quite developed palates, so it’s nice to get their opinions and see how they pick things out and what suggestions they make,” he says.
  A lot of the family’s travels and holidays are also built around food and wine, and as a consequence, Yin How says his children have become incredibly enthusiastic eaters of different cuisines.
  “A lot of our family holidays tend to centre around wine regions or food meccas and the kids are quite used to that. I remember my son was probably four and my daughter about six when I took them to Gaggan (ranked one of the world’s best restaurants) in Bangkok and since that first experience, omakase meals are now their favourite and they can sit through anything raw or exotic,” says Yin How with pride.
  As Hide is a small restaurant offering tasting menus, Shaun notes that considerable precision and skill are required for each dish, which is why he needs to be present as much as possible. — Hide KL/Instagram
  Legacy planning
  Given that so much of their lives and their children’s lives are intertwined with food and the restaurant business, this begs a very natural question: do these dads hope their kids will follow in their footsteps?
  “It’s very hard to say – generally I would say ‘No’ knowing the sacrifices that come with the job and how you don’t really get to spend as much time with your kids as you want to. Like, by the time I get home, my son is already sleeping, so it’s difficult.
  “But I am also very easy-going, so anything that my son decides to do, I will just tell him that he needs to make sure he puts his whole heart into it and not do it half-heartedly,” says Shaun.
  Brian says that his children have developed very good palates and are adventurous eaters. These corn ribs at Bistrot David, for instance, are Hayley's favourite dish. — ART CHEN/The Star
  For Yin How, there is no reason to push his children into something that will consume so much of their time – if they are not actually passionate about it.
  “If they do show an interest and I am still in the business, we can have that conversation because at the moment, there is no clear understanding that they will take over.
  “Also, my kids realise the business is not a walk in the park. F&B is something you must really love – you can’t force it because it’s tough and requires a lot of hard work, odd hours, late nights and sacrifices,” says Yin How.
  Brian, meanwhile, says he himself works very, very hard so that his children will have the opportunity to pursue whatever their interests may be – whether that’s F&B or something else altogether.
  “The reason I work so hard is so that they have the freedom to choose whatever they want to do in their lives,” he explains.
  But in this regard, his children – little though they may be – may already be choosing and carving their own paths.
  Because when asked what she wants to do when she grows up, cheeky little Hayley looks straight at her dad and quips, “I’m going to steal away your shop!”

大部分年轻人“月光族”并非因为乱花钱，而是根本不清楚钱花去哪了。（示意图）
（八打灵再也15日讯）薪水刚发就几乎好无分文？掌握
532黄金公式
，告别
月光族
不是梦！
理财专家佐丹指出，大部分年轻人“破产”并非因为乱花钱，而是根本不清楚钱花去哪了。
ADVERTISEMENT
他分享了一套简单实用的“532黄金预算法”，能有效帮摆脱月光困境。
佐丹建议，将每月收入依照以下比例进行分配，即50% 必要开销：房租、水电、交通、伙食等基本生活费用； 30% 生活享乐：外出聚餐、网购、订阅服务等非必需开销以及20% 储蓄 &和还贷：包括存款、保险、学生贷款等。
他强调，这不是“死公式”，可根据个人情况微调。
“住在雪隆、槟城这种高消费地区，房租占比高很正常，但记住储蓄那一块，永远不能归零。”
他说，理财第一步就是先追踪支出。
“预算不能靠感觉，一定要实际记录每一笔开销。5令吉饮料、10令吉宵夜，看似不起眼，却是‘钱包杀手’。”
“你可以用应用程序或手写记账，清清楚楚自己的每笔消费，关键在于建立金钱意识。”
他还说， 发薪第一件事不是花钱，而是先存钱！
“设定自动转账，把收入分别存入不同用途的户口， 一户日常支出、 一户缴付账单、一户储蓄，不随便动用。你看不到的钱，自然就不会乱花。”
他透露，很多人坚持预算几周后就放弃，是因为没有给自己“呼吸”的空间。
佐丹建议设立“快乐基金”，哪怕每月RM100至RM200，也能让你毫无愧疚地享受生活。
“透过这笔预算，给自买个小礼物、 看场想看的电影或是吃顿慰劳自己的晚餐。”
“这些不是浪费，而是对自己情绪的投资。”
此外，他表示，每个人都得建立“紧急预备金”，应对突发状况。
“人生难免会遇上意外，比如电脑坏了、突发医疗开销、失业等。理想状态是预留3至6个月的基本生活费。”
“但如果你觉得压力大，从500令吉开始，目标1000令吉，一步步来就好。”
他说，很多人以为理财就是不能出门、不能消费，那就错了。
佐丹强调，理财的关键不是压缩生活，而是优化消费方式，那就是少点外卖，多下厨、检查哪些订阅服务根本没在用以及精简“无感支出”。
“理财真正的意义，是掌控感。”从一开始的账目混乱，到后来能清楚知道每一笔钱的去向，你不是只是在管钱，你是在掌控人生节奏。”
掌握532黄金公式，告别月光族不是梦。（网络图）

常见耳机类型对听力的影响各有不同，爱护耳朵，就应正确选对和使用。（示意图）
（台北15日讯）爱耳护听，从正确使用
耳机
开始！
台湾辅大医院耳鼻喉科主任胡皓淳在脸书发文指出，常见耳机类型对
听力
的影响各有不同，他特别列出3种耳机的“风险等级排行”，提醒大众提高警觉。
ADVERTISEMENT
他表示，入耳式或耳塞式耳机 风险最大。这类耳机轻巧便携、深受通勤族喜爱，但也正是最容易伤耳的类型。
他说，这类的耳机 声波直冲耳膜、伤害听觉神经，可能推挤耳垢，引发堵塞、发炎、耳鸣。 长期完全封闭耳道，影响耳压与听觉健康。
“虽然方便，但入耳式耳机是最容易造成听力损害的凶手之一，不建议长时间使用。”
他分析，属于中等风险的耳机则是降噪耳机 。
他透露，在嘈杂环境中，降噪耳机可以让你避免调高音量，有助保护耳朵，但也存在隐忧。
“长时间使用恐导致耳压不适、轻微眩晕，有些人甚至出现焦虑感、生理不平衡。”
“降噪耳机应限时使用，并在安全环境中适当取下，让耳朵回归自然状态。”
他指出，相对友善的耳机是耳罩式耳机。
他表示，耳罩式耳机对耳膜较温和、声音传递距离较长，是相对友善的选择。
“不必调大音量即可听清楚，同时隔绝外部噪音效果好。”
他说， 长时间佩戴可能闷热、细菌滋生，而耳机重量可能导致颈部酸痛、压迫不适。
“配戴1～2小时就应让耳朵休息，并定期清洁耳罩垫，降低感染风险。”
胡皓淳提醒，不管用哪种耳机，都请遵守护耳5原则。
不过音：音量别超过最大音量的60%
不过时：连续使用不超过60分钟
不共用：避免细菌交叉感染
不忽视：出现耳鸣、听力下降要立刻就医
不乱用：在有安全疑虑场合，避免戴耳机
他强调，如果你旁边的人都听得到你的音乐，那代表你音量已经开太大了！
“耳朵只有一对，听力受损就难以恢复。别等失去后才后悔。”
胡皓淳表示，选对耳机很重要，只有选对了才能降低耳朵受损的风险。（脸书图）

陈国雄在文告中强调，工程师不仅要关注道路与结构的安全，也应重视环境的健康。
“我们希望通过这份指南，为各行业提供切实可行的防蚊灭蚊措施，推动跨领域的合作，共同应对这一公共卫生挑战。”
他称，指南重点强调建筑工地管理、排水系统维护、规划与设计考量、公众与工人教育、与地方政府协作。
他也说，登革热不再只是医疗系统的问题，而是需要跨领域、多方协作应对的社会性挑战。因此，所有工程师、发展商及地方政府受促共同承担社会责任，在各自领域内采取积极措施，齐心协力保障人民的健康与安全。
IEM沙巴分会欢迎业界人士索取《登革热预防与控制指南》电子版，或参与即将举行的防疫研讨会与技术交流会，共同提升行业的防控能力。

BERUAS: Malaysia tidak bergantung tinggi hasil pertanian atau makanan daripada Iran yang sedang berdepan situasi perang dengan Israel. Menteri Pertanian dan Keterjaminan Makanan, Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu berkata, kurangnya kebergantungan tersebut adalah disebabkan kesan rantaian sekatan ekonomi kuasa Barat terhadap Iran. Mohamad bagaimanapun berkata, pihaknya memantau keadaan tersebut jika konflik Iran-Israel itu merebak ke negara-negara lain yang membekalkan hasil pertanian dan makanan kepada Malaysia. “Import makanan kita tidak tinggi (dari Iran). Yang banyak dari India dan Pakistan. Ini kerana Iran hadapi sekatan. Kalau ada yang import daripada Iran pun, adalah…

BERUAS, June 15 (Bernama) -- Malaysia is not heavily dependent on food imports from Iran, and as such, the situation does not impact the country’s food supply, said Agriculture and Food Security Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu.
  He explained that Malaysia’s food import requirements from Iran are limited to dates and legume products, which are not among the country’s primary food commodities.
  "Most of our food imports (requirements) from Iran are not high (from Iran), Most of our imports are from India, Pakistan, the Middle East, China and ASEAN countries,” he told a press conference after visiting the Perak State Farmers’ Organisation (PPN) cattle rearing project at PPN Perak Kampung Tengah here today.
  Meanwhile, when asked about the impact of the current hot weather on padi crops, Mohamad said that so far, 60 per cent of the country's padi production remains unaffected.
  However, he said, adjustments to the padi planting schedule may be necessary based on discussions with the Muda Agricultural Development Authority (MADA) and the Kemubu Agricultural Development Authority (KADA).
  "Sometimes we need to change the (planting) schedule a little and so on, depending on weather conditions and suitability," he said.
  Regarding today's visit, Mohamad said the ministry would assist the livestock farm, which currently houses about 500 animals, in building a slaughterhouse to help increase the farm’s productivity.
  "We have set a target to achieve a meat self-sufficiency level (SSL) of more than 30 per cent by 2030, compared to 20 per cent currently. With the developments we are seeing now, we are confident of reaching the goal,” he said.

（勿述15日马新社讯）农业及粮食安全部长拿督斯里莫哈末沙布指出，马来西亚没有过度依赖从伊朗进口食品，因此伊朗与以色列的冲突局势不会影响我国粮食供应。
  他解释，我国从伊朗进口的食品主要是椰枣和豆类产品，而这类商品并非我国的主要粮食。
  “我们的食品进口大多不是来自伊朗，反而主要来自印度、巴基斯坦、中东、中国和东盟国家。
  “我们将持续关注伊朗与以色列冲突进展，观察是否会蔓延至其他国家，或仅属短暂性冲突。”
  他今日巡视位于甘榜登雅的霹雳州农民组织（PPN）牛只养殖场后，在记者会上这么说。
  近日以色列对伊朗多地发动系列攻击，造成该国数名高级军官和科学家丧命，伊朗随后反击，向以色列多个地点发射弹道导弹，造成数人死亡及受伤。
  此外，针对近期酷热天气对稻作的影响，莫哈末沙布说，目前全国约60%的稻米产量未受影响。
  不过，他说，稻作种植计划需要与慕达农业发展局（MADA）及格姆布农业发展局（KADA）讨论后作出调整。
  “有时我们需要稍微调整种植时间，这取决于天气状况及适种条件。”
  至于今日的巡视行程，他说，该部将协助该饲养约500头牛的养殖场建设屠宰中心，以提高生产力。
  “我们的目标是在2030年前将牛肉自给率（SSL）从目前的20%提高至超过30%，我们有信心在当前发展趋势下能达成目标。”

砂人联党中央青年团副宣教秘书暨都东支部青年团团长尹士华呼吁政府在扩大征税之前，应确保政策公开、透明、公平，并设法减轻中低收入家庭的负担。
（诗巫16日讯）砂人联党中央青年团副宣教秘书暨都东支部青年团团长尹士华呼吁政府在
扩大
征税之前，应确保政策公开、透明、公平，并设法减轻中低收入家庭的负担。不要再用“奢侈品”做幌子，去掩盖一个全民加税的现实。
他今日发文告指出，政府将从2025年7月1日起，扩大销售与服务税（
SST
）征收范围，财政部宣称主要针对进口奢侈品如三文鱼、牛油果、奢侈品等，不会影响大众。然而，最新宪报却揭露了完全不同的真相。
ADVERTISEMENT
“根据宪报显示，大量日常食材列入征税清单，包括香蕉、苹果、芒果、榴梿、即食面、罐头食品、果汁、咖啡、食油、调味料、冷冻肉类等。换句话说，人们每天吃的饭、喝的饮料，几乎都要多缴税。更令人担忧的是，这些‘本地常见食材’很多是属于进口，来自泰国、中国、越南、印度等。一旦被列为应税品，售价势必跟着上涨。”
尹士华认为必须关注3个关键问题，其一是价格悄悄上涨，账单却不清楚，销售与服务税不像消费税般透明，不会列出每项商品缴了多少税。消费者只会感觉“怎么全部都贵了”，却找不到原因。

林冠英再次呼吁联邦政府暂缓落实征收销售及服务税措施。（曾雪爱摄）
（槟城15日讯）峇眼国会议员
林冠英
指出，除了苹果和橙这类进口水果被征收5%销售及服务税(SST），同属进口货的年柑和椰枣（Kurma）也首次被征税！
他再次呼吁联邦政府暂缓落实上述措施，否则在农历新年和斋戒月时，政府肯定难逃被骂。
ADVERTISEMENT
林冠英也是阿逸布爹州议员，他今日出席一项昌明社区活动后说，尽管苹果及橙是进口水果，但这些水果已不属于“有钱人的水果”，而是普通百姓日常在食用，不该征税。
他说，政府担心进口水果冲击本地水果的销量，但榴梿和山竹等本地水果，价格反而更高更贵，但销量却不受影响。
他指出，自从联邦政府宣布将于7月1日扩大落实销售及服务税的领域后，各行业公会都出声反对，而政府征税最终将由消费者承担，羊毛出在羊身上，加剧人民的生活负担。
“目前不只有关税政策，还面对著中东地区战争，让全球经济不景，政府应暂缓落实相关措施，并再召集各行各业相关业者再做讨论。”
另外，他说，此次扩大征税，业主的年租金收入超过50万令吉，租户缴付的月租必须征税8%，令很多人大感不满。
他解释，这是因为一旦租户被征收销售与服务税，他们等同一年必须缴纳多一个月租金，加重了他们的负担。
不过，他赞成政府向前来大马寻求私人医疗护理服务的外国人征税6%，因为这是合理的政策。

（红土坎15日讯）首相拿督斯里安华坦言，
消费税
（
GST
）是更为便捷和容易的税务，但所有人民包括贫苦人民都需要缴付，目前仍未是时候。
“消费税是很有效，而且更容易，每个人都需要缴付，不必头痛。但渔民、小农民、底层劳工都必须缴付（消费税）…如果明天我们的经济、最低薪资就提升，就可以实行，现在未是时候。”
ADVERTISEMENT
他也打趣称，在此课题上抨击政府的反对党，应该要去上一些课程，以明白这一点。
他说，如今政府实施销售与服务税（SST），却有人不满，说香蕉都要缴税。
“是进口香蕉才要缴税，本地种的不需要，先读清楚。比如牛油果，进口的，价格昂贵，有钱人要吃就吃吧，但多给一些钱。”

当前情况下，我国更应优先保障国内消费力，强化内需作为经济增长的支柱，以稳固整体经济的基本面，而非在内外部不利因素交叠之际推行可能抑制消费信心的税制改革。


ADVERTISEMENT

政府日前宣布，从7月1日起调整销售与服务税（SST）制度，正式迈出税制改革的重要一步。根据新措施，奢侈品将被征收高达10%的销售税，部分非必需进口食品如三文鱼和草莓将征收5%销售税；与此同时，服务税的适用范围将扩大，涵盖租金、建筑、金融服务、私人医疗保险、美容与教育等领域。
财政部指出，此举旨在落实2025年财政预算案所承诺的更具进步性税制改革，在不加重一般民众负担的前提下，提高国家财政收入。政府也强调，基本民生用品与核心服务将不会被征收销售税，亦不纳入服务税征收范围。面对此起彼伏的财政支出需求，尤其是援助计划、公共医疗和教育领域的投入，政府表示唯有扩大SST税基，方能开拓新财政来源，为2026年与2027年创造更大财政空间。尽管市场早前已对SST改革有所预期，但此次具体政策的公布仍引发不少关注与疑虑。究竟，此时扩大销售与服务税的时机是否合适？这项政策将为市场与我国经济带来何种影响？

首先，尽管此次销售与服务税（SST）的扩大明确指出，基本民生用品与核心服务将继续获得豁免，不受税率调整影响，但这并不意味着其他商品和服务的调涨只会波及特定消费群体。事实上，经济是一个高度互联的整体系统，任何一个环节受到冲击，最终都会以直接或间接的方式传导至整个经济体系，影响所有消费者和企业。

此次SST调整的幅度广泛，涵盖了奢侈品、部分非必需进口食品，以及多个服务领域。随着如进口三文鱼、进口水果等物品开始被征收SST，这些价格上涨的商品虽然并非生活必需，但其涨价将推动整体生活成本上升。而商家和服务供应者面对成本转嫁压力，也可能借此调整价格，进一步推高其他商品和服务的价格水平。


更重要的是，市场行为往往建立在“预期”之上。一旦通胀预期被激活，即使部分商品或服务本身未直接调涨价格，也有可能因连带效应而引发广泛价格上行。例如，运输业、零售业或中游制造行业面对成本增加时，最终也会将成本传导至终端消费者，形成更大范围的通胀压力。

此外，SST调整并非单一因素。接下来的几个月，我国经济还将面对一系列可能推升通胀预期的政策变化，例如7月即将生效的电费调涨、渐进全面实施的电子发票制度、以及下半年即将推行的RON95汽油针对性补贴制度。这些因素叠加之下，不仅将提高企业经营成本，也可能削弱消费信心，加剧市场对未来价格上行的预期，进而造成实际的通胀压力。简而言之，即使SST扩大政策表面上看似“有选择性”地征税，但在一个高度交织的经济体系中，没有人能完全置身事外。价格的上涨不仅影响被征税商品的消费者，更会在经济链条中层层传导，最终影响整个市场，甚至对中长期经济增长和社会民生带来深远影响。

那么，当前是否为扩大和调整销售与服务税（SST）税基的合适时机？从理论上看，许多人或许会认为现在正是推行该项措施的“窗口期”——毕竟大马的通胀率近期持续维持在较低水平。数据显示，2024年3月与4月的通胀率均维持在1.4%左右，属于相对温和的通胀环境。在这种背景下扩大税基，理论上可以在不引发过度物价上涨的情况下，为政府创造额外财政收入。
然而，这种理论前提是经济处于稳健，消费与投资活跃，市场信心充足的状态下。但实际情况远非如此。当前的大马经济环境正处于不确定中前行。通胀率维持低位，背后可能并非经济健康的信号，反而可能反映内需疲弱、消费力放缓的隐忧。
更令人担忧的是，全球经济正面临严峻挑战。美国加征关税政策带来的不确定性，将直接冲击我国对外出口，加剧我国出口疲弱的风险。在全球需求放缓、外部市场趋冷的情况下，大马将难以依赖出口作为短期内的增长引擎。此时，唯有依靠内需，尤其是私人消费，才能稳定经济基本盘，发挥“压舱石”的作用。
然而，就在这个关键时刻，国内经济支柱企业也出现隐忧。国家石油公司（Petronas）因盈利下滑，计划大幅裁员及冻结招聘，而雇员公积金局（EPF）2025年首季的投资回酬亦出现下跌，同比减少13%。它们不仅是国家的战略性机构，其动向也往往反映整个宏观经济的脉络。它们所面对的盈利压力和调整举措，极可能削弱就业市场与投资情绪，进一步影响民间消费能力。
在这多重内外压力叠加的背景下，贸然扩大SST税基，不仅将推升成本与价格预期，也有可能削弱消费者信心，抑制原本已显脆弱的内需表现。这将削弱我国抵御全球经济下行风险的“最后一道防线”。因此，此时此刻扩大与调整SST税制，时机显然并不理想。与其急于通过增加税收来弥补财政空间，不如暂缓相关措施，优先稳住国内消费力，激励内需，为接下来可能面临的全球经济风暴提供更坚实的缓冲。唯有如此，才能确保国家经济在外部动荡中维持一定的韧性与增长潜力。
综上所述，政府此次扩大与调整SST税制的根本动因，主要是出于财政压力，以及落实2023年公共财政与财政责任法下的目标——即将财政赤字压低至3.8%，并将国家债务占GDP的比率控制在60%以内。政策方向虽有其逻辑基础，但任何财政政策的设计与执行，必须结合现实经济环境，因时而动、因势而变，不能一味为了达成长期财政目标而忽视短期经济稳定的需要。政府在2025年财政预算案中确实早已提出扩大税基的计划，但当时并未预见到美国关税政策变化所带来的全球经济不确定性，也未预料国际市场需求将明显放缓。当前情况下，我国更应优先保障国内消费力，强化内需作为经济增长的支柱，以稳固整体经济的基本面，而非在内外部不利因素交叠之际推行可能抑制消费信心的税制改革。
在财政紧张的现实下，政府不妨优先从“节流”着手，例如检讨与暂缓部分非关键的公共开支与发展项目，以缓解短期财政压力。这种做法不仅可避免对消费市场造成负面冲击，也更贴近当前的宏观经济节奏。考虑到美元走弱及全球经济衰退的趋势，即使我国在短期内未能显著压低财政赤字，对马币汇率的负面影响也有限。比起过度强调赤字目标，更应关注如何稳住经济基本盘，提振市场信心，确保人民生活成本不过快上升，才能在全球风浪之中稳住国家经济航向。

Minggu lalu, Kementerian Kewangan memaklumkan kadar cukai sifar bagi keperluan asas dikekalkan manakala kadar antara 5% hingga 10% dikenakan ke atas barangan bukan keperluan mulai 1 Julai. (Gambar Bernama)
PETALING JAYA
:
Kerajaan perlu mempunyai kerangka percukaian holistik dan jelas sebelum sebarang dasar dilaksanakan termasuk peluasan skop cukai jualan dan perkhidmatan (SST) bermula 1 Julai depan.
Ketua Penerangan Perikatan Nasional (PN) Radzi Jidin berkata dasar itu perlu dibatalkan sehingga kerajaan dapat membangunkan satu sistem yang tidak membebankan kebanyakan rakyat.
Dalam masa sama, Radzi yang juga Ahli Parlimen Putrajaya turut meminta kerajaan menekankan kepada pembentukan jaringan keselamatan sosial yang holistik, sistematik dan teratur dalam menangani kenaikan kos.
Radzi Jidin.
“Jadilah kerajaan prihatin dan memahami kesukaran rakyat bukan ambil jalan mudah melaksanakan dasar tidak mempunyai kerangka jelas semata-mata untuk meningkatkan hasil negara,” katanya dalam kenyataan.
Selain peluasan SST, pemimpin Bersatu berkenaan turut mengaitkan kerangka tidak jelas itu dengan rancangan kerajaan untuk melaksanakan subsidi bersasar RON95 pada pertengahan kedua tahun ini.
Menurut Radzi, pelaksanaannya juga perlu ditangguh memandangkan belum ada kerangka jelas selain kesan kepada kos sara hidup, peningkatan perbelanjaan operasi perniagaan dan ketidaktentuan ekonomi global.
“PN gesa kerajaan tangguh dahulu pelaksanaan subsidi bersasar,” katanya yang turut mengulangi gesaan menangguhkan pelarasan tarif elektrik.
Minggu lalu, Kementerian Kewangan memaklumkan kadar cukai sifar bagi keperluan asas dikekalkan manakala kadar antara 5% hingga 10% dikenakan ke atas barangan bukan keperluan mulai 1 Julai.
Cukai perkhidmatan pula akan diperluaskan merangkumi sewaan, pajakan, pembinaan, perkhidmatan kewangan, penjagaan kesihatan swasta dan pendidikan.
Jumaat lalu, Ketua Setiausaha Perbendaharaan Johan Mahmood Merican menjelaskan seramai 5.4 juta golongan berpendapatan rendah dan sederhana dijangka mendapat manfaat daripada langkah itu.
Menurutnya, jangkaan peningkatan hasil menerusi dasar bermula 1 Julai itu dijangka membantu memberi kemampuan kepada kerajaan menyalurkan bantuan dan melindungi golongan rentan termasuk B40 dan M40.
Mulai April lalu, jumlah penerima Sumbangan Asas Rahmah (SARA) meningkat kepada 5.4 juta penerima berbanding 700,000 sebelum ini.
Tahun ini, kerajaan memperuntukkan RM13 bilion untuk menyalurkan bantuan menerusi SARA dan Sumbangan Tunai Rahmah (STR).

LUMUT, June 15 (Bernama) -- The government is not ready to reintroduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as it would affect all segments of society, particularly the poor, said Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
  The Prime Minister said GST is a broad-based tax that would be applied uniformly to all consumers, regardless of income, including fishermen, smallholders, or street cleaners.
  “GST taxes everybody. While it is efficient and straightforward, just six per cent across the board, I must ask, if everyone has to pay six per cent, why should the poor and the unemployed be taxed as well?” he said when closing the Perak MADANI Rakyat Programme (PMR) 2025 here today.
  Anwar said that although the opposition has suggested GST as a better option, the government has chosen to postpone its implementation to avoid burdening the people, who are still struggling with the rising cost of living.
  “That’s why we say we’re not ready for GST. If, one day, the economy improves and the minimum wage reaches RM4,000 or more, then by all means, implement GST. But for now, I’m calling for it to be postponed, don’t turn it into a political issue,” he said.

蔡兆生呼吁政府，暂缓扩大销售与服务税（SST）措施。
（关丹15日讯）彭亨中华总商会会长拿督斯里蔡兆生呼吁政府，暂缓扩大销售与服务税（SST）措施，并建议重启销售税（GST）制度，以更惠及商民。
他指出，政府宣布扩大SST的消息，引发业界新的担忧。
ADVERTISEMENT
“若被征税，将大幅提高企业投资成本，打击企业扩张与转型的意愿，尤其对制造业和中小企业冲击最大。”
“在当前经济复苏尚未稳固的情况下，政府应暂缓扩大SST的措施，以免企业营运成本上升，最终转嫁消费者，推高物价，加重人民生活负担。”
他表示，该会支持中总建议，将SST的营业额起征门槛调高至200万令吉，好让更多微型与小型企业受惠，避免过早被卷入税制负担，阻碍成长。
蔡兆生是于今日，在彭亨中华总商会2025年度会员大会上致词时，如是表示。
出席者包括署理会长拿督林火莉、副会长颜振文及拿督周金镑、秘书陆祖发等。

蔡兆生表示，理解政府推行税务改革与改善财政管理的必要性，但任何新政策的实施都应考虑时机与企业的承受能力，避免节奏过快引发混乱，适得其反。
“本会建议政府认真考虑重新引入GST。”
他认为，与目前的SST相比，GST是一种更具公平性、透明度及效率的间接税制度，在许多国家已被实践证明成效良好。
“GST覆盖面广，不论是商品或服务，只要进入市场流通，基本上都纳入征税，能够有效减少逃税漏洞，确保更多经济活动纳入税制管理，增强国家财政的稳定性。”
“更重要的是，GST制度对于企业本身也有不少好处。”
他指出，GST允许商家抵扣进项税，有助于减少重复征税的问题，提升企业的现金流管理与成本控制能力，特别是在供应链长、采购环节多的行业尤为显著。
“此外，统一与清晰的税务制度也提升企业对税务规划的可预见性，有利于企业制定更长远的发展策略。”
出席者举手通过提案。（梁镇强摄）
他指出，现在的经济环境真的很不容易，除了全球经济的不稳定，本地商家也面对一些政府政策带来的压力。
“虽然内陆税收局宣布，年收入或销售额低于50万令吉的商家，暂时豁免实施电子发票制度；而年收入或销售额介于100万至500万令吉的商家，则展延至明年1月1日执行。”
“这项决定让许多中小企业暂时松一口气，减少了在短时间内应对技术和行政要求的压力。”
他也指出，欢迎政府延长雇佣合约印花税迟交罚款的宽限期至今年12月31日，这有助于减轻企业行政压力。
“目前规定只有月薪300令吉以下的雇佣合约豁免盖章，早已不符合现今的经济与薪资水平。”
他建议政府把豁免门槛调高至1万令吉，更贴近实际，协助更多雇主减轻负担。
他认为，经济要持续发展，离不开政府与商民之间的紧密合作。
“政府负责制定宏观政策、营造良好的营商环境，而商家和人民则是推动经济活力的实际执行者与贡献者。”
“两者各司其职、互相支持，才能形成良性循环，共同推动国家迈向繁荣。”
此外，蔡兆生也特别邀请大家，出席于7月5日，由其领导的劳勿中华商会举办的会庆。
“一起见证劳勿在地企业家的努力与成就，也一同为地方经济加油打气。”
大会也通过以下提案：
1/东海岸铁道通车在即，呼吁州政府在东海岸铁道沿线地带，积极整合各地生态与文化资源，广邀私人企业一起参与打造生态旅游卖点，成为国际旅游品牌
2/促请政府继续优化电子发票政策，将暂缓50万豁免门槛，改为永久性豁免
3/呼吁多媒体委员会(MCMC)尊重人民个人隐私权，即刻喊停强制电讯公司呈交电话用户详尽个资
4/促请教育部撤销A-不算A法规，无条件录取所有10A状元生，进入大学预科班
5/对等关税混战阴霾笼罩，经济生态低迷不振，呼吁政府体恤商家民众困境，暂缓推行汽油补贴合理化，水费电费调涨，扩大销售税征抽范围以及其他任何增加企业成本的商贸政策
6/呼吁地方政府考虑实际情况，接受雇主和业者的反馈，修订放宽员工短期宿舍指南和法规，以取得官民双赢，尽早完成宿舍修建计划
7/促请政府接受商家民众的请愿，撤销雇用合约强制缴付印花税
8/呼吁华青抓紧机会，积极报考与人工智能，大数据，量化分析以及芯片工艺相关科系，以组装最强大的竞争力，迎接AI世界的竞争和角力。

LUMUT: Kerajaan belum bersedia untuk melaksanakan semula sistem Cukai Barang dan Perkhidmatan (GST) ketika ini kerana ekonomi rakyat belum pulih sepenuhnya.
  Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim berkata, walaupun GST merupakan sistem percukaian yang dilihat lebih teratur dan menyeluruh, namun pelaksanaannya tidak sesuai pada masa ini kerana membebankan seluruh lapisan masyarakat termasuk golongan miskin.
  Menurutnya, jika ekonomi negara pulih sepenuhnya dan gaji minimum sehingga RM4,000 ke atas boleh dilaksanakan, sistem GST boleh dilaksanakan ketika itu.
  “Sistem GST ini maknanya cukai terhadap semua (rakyat), walaupun kadarnya rendah tapi semua rakyat kena cukai. Kalau tanya saya, GST memang yang sistem baik, senang sahaja, cukai kepada semua tapi adakah nelayan, pekebun kecil, pekerja bawahan seperti tukang cuci jalan juga harus dikenakan cukai?
  “Sebab itu kita kata belum sedia untuk GST, kalau esok ekonomi meningkat katalah gaji minumum RM4,000 ke atas, cukailah GST pun,” katanya.
  Beliau berkata demikian ketika berucap dalam perasmian penutup Program MADANI Rakyat 2025 Perak di Lumut Waterfront di sini hari ini.
  Hadir sama, Menteri Besar Perak, Datuk Seri Saarani Mohamad dan Menteri Pendidikan Tinggi, Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir.
  Menurut Anwar, kerajaan ketika ini memilih untuk meneruskan sistem Cukai Jualan dan Perkhidmatan (SST) kerana ia lebih bersasar dan hanya mengenakan cukai kepada barangan tertentu, khususnya barangan import mewah.
  Beliau berkata, contohnya beberapa barangan import seperti avokado, ikan kod dan buah-buahan yang dikenakan cukai kerana hanya dinikmati oleh golongan berpendapatan tinggi.
  “Kita kenakan cukai avokado, ikan kod. Kita cukai barang mahal, orang kaya nak makan, silakan, tapi bayarlah lebih,” katanya.
  Anwar menegaskan kutipan cukai bukan untuk membebankan rakyat, tetapi sebagai sumber penting bagi membiayai keperluan asas dan pembangunan negara namun akan memastikan sistem cukai yang dilaksanakan tidak membebankan rakyat.
  “Kalau tak cukai, nak ambil wang dari mana nak buat hospital di Manjung? Nak baiki jalan berlubang? Nak bina kapal, beli pesawat pertahanan negara? Semua itu guna duit cukai,” katanya.
  Dalam pada itu, Anwar turut menempelak tindakan pembangkang yang memainkan isu GST sebagai modal politik tanpa memahami kesannya terhadap rakyat.
  “Ahli Parlimen pembangkang kena bagi kursus sikit. Dia nak sedap saja kata GST bagus. Kamu fahamkah apa GST? Perkhidmatan cukai menyeluruh, you tax everybody.
  “Pembangkang kata GST efisyen. Saya nak tanya, kalau enam peratus (cukai GST) semua kena bayar, mengapa orang miskin kena bayar? Mengapa orang menganggur pergi makan pun kena bayar?
  “Jadi saya minta faham, kita tangguh GST. Pembangkang hanya nak jadikan bahan politik tak tentu arah,” katanya. – UTUSAN

LUMUT: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim reiterated the government’s stance against reintroducing the goods and services tax (GST) as it would unfairly burden lower-income earners.
  Anwar said on the surface, GST looks like a good system as it is simple, easier to manage with just a flat 6%, and everyone pays, including the poor and the unemployed.
  He said the implementation of GST would mean the poor, including fishermen, smallholders, low-wage earners and street vendors, would be taxed on everyday essentials.
  “GST is a broad-based tax. Everyone pays, even for sugar, flour and basic food items.
  “Yes, it is systematic and easy to implement, but is it fair, as the poor or the unemployed will need to pay taxes just to eat?” he said in his speech at the closing of the Madani Rakyat programme at the Lumut Waterfront here on Sunday (June 15).
  He was responding to repeated claims by Opposition MPs that GST would be a better system compared to the existing sales and service tax (SST).
  Anwar said it would be all right to implement GST should the country's economy grow stronger and if the minimum wage is above RM4,000.
  He also defended the government’s continued reliance on SST, noting that it targets imported and luxury goods rather than daily necessities.
  ALSO READ:  Expanded SST impacts essential goods, says Dr Wee
  “When imported bananas were taxed, people made noise, but these are not the local bananas like pisang mas or rastali – those are not taxed.
  “It is the imported bananas, avocados and codfish, for example, that are taxed, because these are mostly consumed by the wealthy,” he said.
  He added that taxes collected under SST help fund critical public services and national defence.
  “If we do not collect taxes, how do we repair hospitals, fix roads, build schools, or buy new aircraft for our Armed Forces?
  “These are not luxuries, but necessities funded by national revenue, including taxes,” he said.
  Anwar also dismissed claims that the government was burdening the people with electricity tariff hikes, pointing out that 85% of consumers did not experience any increase.
  “So those shouting about defending the Malays and Islam, who are you really defending? The rich? Because the village people did not see their bills go up. The rich did,” he added.
  He admitted that no taxation system is perfect, but welcomed feedback and promised adjustments where needed.
  “I am not saying SST is flawless. If there are hiccups affecting businesses, we can sit down, discuss, and improve.
  "But people must understand why taxes are needed," he said.
  
------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 — Umno Youth chief Datuk Dr Akmal Saleh is pushing the government to reinstate the Goods and Services Tax (GST), saying it is a better and more effective taxation system than the current Sales and Services Tax (SST).
  He said although the 6 per cent GST previously implemented was criticised for burdening the people, the current system is even more taxing.
  “Previously, the six per cent GST was said to burden the people,” he said in a Facebook post today.
  “Now, people have to pay SST – 5 or 10 per cent sales tax plus 6 per cent service tax – in addition to a reduction in the number of taxable goods from 8,084 items to only 1,813 items.”
  Akmal urged the government not to shy away from acknowledging that the former GST system was more efficient and less burdensome on the public.
  “Our suggestion to the government is to reintroduce the GST, which is far better and more effective.
  “Don’t be ashamed or hesitant to admit that the previous GST policy was better and did not burden the people,” he said.
  He also dismissed the idea that the Pakatan Harapan manifesto – which had promised to abolish GST – should be seen as set in stone.
  “Don’t just use the excuse that the manifesto to abolish GST is a holy book.
  “What matters is that the people are not burdened and taxes can be collected efficiently,” he said.
  The Barisan Nasional government introduced the GST on April 1, 2015, and it was abolished on June 1, 2018 when the first PH administration was voted into power.

（关丹15日讯）大马刘氏总会副总会长拿督刘春呼吁政府，豁免
进口水果
5%销售与服务税（SST）的举措。
“大家都在关注将在下个月1日落实的扩大销售与服务税政策，我本身也曾经发表了整体的看法和提出政府应该暂缓实施的建议，主要是认为，政府在与美国完成关税谈判和争取积极成果、令吉汇率稳定以及国家经济更稳定后，才考虑实施这项政策。”

他指出，下月开始所有进口水果将被征收5% SST的问题。
“这项政策下，我们大家都比较关注的是进口的苹果、橙子、梨子和葡萄，因为这些水果多年来，一直都是我国各族人民，尤其是华裔同胞在日常生活中不可或缺的水果或健康食材。”
“不只如此，它也是华社在宗教或祭祖仪式中，供上供和拜祭的必要水果，我希望，在这方面，政府能够认真考虑，并给予豁免征税，让各族人民继续享有如目前般的价廉物美。”

刘春补充，大家喜爱的苹果，价格可说是人人可负担，包括橙子在内，很多时候甚至比“本地柑”还要便宜好吃，而且产量和供应稳定！
“我也了解到，本地生产牛油果比进口的还要贵，而且另外一些如葡萄，则是本地所没有的，但多年来已经成为我国人民的日常水果。”

“If, one day, the economy improves and the minimum wage reaches RM4,000 or more, then by all means, implement GST.
“But for now, I’m calling for it to be postponed. Don’t turn it into a political issue,” he said.
Anwar said the sales and service yax (SST), in current use, is more targeted in nature.
It taxes imported luxury items such as avocados and cod — products typically consumed by high-income earners — instead of local products like bananas.
Anwar said the tax revenue collected is used to develop infrastructure that benefits the people, such as hospitals, schools and the national defence system.
It will also fund various development and welfare initiatives that directly benefit the people.
Anwar said although there are weaknesses in the SST system, the government remained open to reviewing and enhancing it comprehensively in the nation’s best interests.

LUMUT, June 15 — The government is not ready to reintroduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as it would affect all segments of society, particularly the poor, said Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
  The Prime Minister said GST is a broad-based tax that would be applied uniformly to all consumers, regardless of income, including fishermen, smallholders, or street cleaners.
  “GST taxes everybody. While it is efficient and straightforward, just six per cent across the board, I must ask, if everyone has to pay six per cent, why should the poor and the unemployed be taxed as well?” he said when closing the Perak Madani Rakyat Programme (PMR) 2025 here today.
  Anwar said that although the opposition has suggested GST as a better option, the government has chosen to postpone its implementation to avoid burdening the people, who are still struggling with the rising cost of living.
  “That’s why we say we’re not ready for GST. If, one day, the economy improves and the minimum wage reaches RM4,000 or more, then by all means, implement GST. But for now, I’m calling for it to be postponed, don’t turn it into a political issue,” he said.
  Anwar said the government is retaining the Sales and Services Tax (SST), which is more targeted in nature, particularly on imported luxury items such as avocados and cod, products typically consumed by high-income earners.
  “Local bananas are not taxed, but expensive imported fruits like avocados, usually consumed by those in the high-income group, should come with a slightly higher price. The same goes for cod, which is also imported and costly, so we tax it,” he said.
  As such, he emphasised that the tax revenue collected from these imported and high-end goods could be used to develop infrastructure that benefits the people, such as hospitals, schools, and the national defence system.
  However, Anwar said the tax revenue collected by the government is not solely meant to cover the country’s operating expenditure, but also to fund various development and welfare initiatives that directly benefit the people.
  According to the Prime Minister, although there are weaknesses in the SST system, the government remains open to reviewing and enhancing it comprehensively in the nation’s best interest. — Bernama

Perdana Menteri Anwar Ibrahim, berkata kerajaan ambil pendirian tangguh GST kerana tidak mahu bebankan rakyat dengan tekanan kos sara hidup.
PETALING JAYA
:
Kerajaan belum bersedia melaksanakan semula cukai barang dan perkhidmatan (GST) walaupun ia lebih mudah dan cekap, kata Perdana Menteri Anwar Ibrahim.
Anwar berkata, GST merupakan cukai menyeluruh yang akan dikenakan secara sama rata kepada semua pengguna tanpa mengira pendapatan termasuk nelayan, pekebun kecil atau tukang cuci jalan.
“GST ini anda kenakan cukai pada semua orang…walaupun ia efisien, lebih mudah tak payah pening-pening kepala, senang saja enam peratus semua bayar. Tapi saya nak tanya, kalau enam peratus itu semua kena bayar, mengapa orang miskin, orang menganggur kena bayar?”, katanya menurut Bernama pada Majlis Penutup Program Madani Rakyat (PMR) 2025 Perak, di Lumut.
Anwar berkata, walaupun ada cadangan daripada pembangkang yang mengatakan bahawa GST lebih baik, kerajaan ketika ini mengambil pendirian untuk menangguhkannya kerana tidak mahu membebankan rakyat yang masih berhadapan dengan tekanan kos sara hidup.
“Sebab itu kita kata belum bersedia GST ini. Kalau esok ekonomi kita dah meningkat, gaji minima semua RM4,000 ke atas, cukailah GST pun. Jadi saya minta tangguh ini (GST), (jangan) dibuat jadi bahan politik,” katanya.
Sebaliknya, Anwar berkata kerajaan kini mengekalkan pelaksanaan cukai jualan dan perkhidmatan (SST) yang lebih bersasar, terutama ke atas barangan import mewah seperti buah avocado atau ikan kod yang lazimnya dinikmati golongan berpendapatan tinggi.
“Pisang tempatan (Malaysia) tidak dikenakan cukai, tapi buah-buahan import yang mahal seperti avocado yang lazimnya dinikmati oleh orang berpendapatan tinggi, mereka yang ingin menikmatinya perlulah membayar lebih sikit. Begitu juga ikan kod yang juga diimport dan mahal, jadi kita cukailah,” katanya.
Justeru, perdana menteri menegaskan hasil kutipan cukai daripada barangan import dan mahal itu, akan dapat digunakan untuk membangunkan infrastruktur yang memberi manfaat kepada rakyat termasuk hospital, sekolah serta sistem pertahanan negara.
Bagaimanapun Anwar berkata hasil cukai yang dikutip kerajaan bukan sekadar untuk menampung perbelanjaan operasi negara, tetapi ia juga bagi membiayai pelbagai inisiatif pembangunan dan kebajikan yang memberi faedah secara langsung kepada rakyat.
Beliau berkata walaupun terdapat kelemahan dalam pelaksanaan SST, kerajaan sentiasa terbuka untuk menilai dan menambah baik sistem berkenaan secara menyeluruh demi kepentingan negara.
“… ada kelemahan dalam SST. Kita boleh bincang, kita tengok, kita perbaiki. Tetapi kena faham mengapa cukai dikenakan. Saya nak tanya (kenapa) hospital harus diperbaiki atau sekolah harus ditingkatkan keupayaannya?
“Sekarang ini ada kecerdasan buatan (AI), teknologi digital, nak baiki jalan atau tidak… jadi kalau semua nak, wang itu nak ambil daripada mana? Dari cukailah. Jadi sebab itu kita usaha bawa pelaburan dan dapat (peluang) pekerjaan,” kata Perdana Menteri.

首相安华为扩大销售与服务税（SST）范围的决定辩护，更列举向进口水果，如牛油果征税，旨在向富人征税。
  他在谈及对进口水果征收5%的销售税时，试图暗示这只会影响食用昂贵水果，如牛油果的群体。
  “最近（新闻报道说）进口货品，如香蕉也会被征税，结果大家都发飙了。”
  “人民也在红土坎种香蕉，我们还需进口香蕉？进口的香蕉可不是‘金蕉’、‘阿哇蕉’、‘红肉蕉’这种本地品种。”
  “读好好来，不要随便就开骂。涨价的是进口水果，比如想吃牛油果的人。我听说政府（部门）的秘书长就吃牛油果。”

(Reuters) -World number one Jannik Sinner wants to use the Halle Open as a chance to bounce back from sleepless nights after his agonising loss to rival Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final this month.
  In a thrilling showdown, Sinner took the first two sets and had three match points in the fourth set, but Spaniard Alcaraz persevered to grind out a 4-6 6-7(4) 6-4 7-6(3) 7-6(10-2) win in five hours and 29 minutes - the longest final at Roland Garros.
  Asked if he had thought about the championship points he failed to convert, Sinner told reporters on Saturday: "Often. It happens. I don't know how it will look in the future.
  "I think that it is not the most important thing, but I nevertheless try to forget the negative things and see what I can do here" in Halle. 
  "I think that for me to play another tournament is positive, because every match is a new beginning, and I must be mentally ready to give my all on the court. Therefore, it is great I can be here in Halle. Yes, I had already a few sleepless nights, but I think every day it gets better."
  The 23-year-old Italian is the reigning champion at Halle and will seek to defend his crown at the tournament, which starts on Monday, as he gears up for Wimbledon, which will be held from June 30 to July 13 at the All England Lawn Tennis Club.
  "The first practice session was OK. I hadn’t played since Paris, so my general feelings on the court were not so perfect," Sinner said. 
  "I think a good grass-court player can move well. The ball can bounce a bit funny because of the grass, and you have to serve intelligently.
  "But in general, it is a surface on which I took a step forward last year and we will see how it goes this year."

LUMUT, June 15 (Bernama) -- Two persons with disabilities (PwDs) were among 183 applicants who successfully secured jobs after passing interview sessions held during the MYFutureJobs Career Carnival at the Perak MADANI Rakyat Programme (PMR) 2025 at Lumut Waterfront, here.
  Social Security Organisation (SOCSO) Teluk Intan branch manager S. Mageswari said that the PMR 2025 programme offered approximately 1,793 job opportunities across various fields and employment sectors nationwide.
  “Over the past two days, and including today, the third day, the response has been very encouraging, with many job seekers attending the interview sessions. For Perak PMR 2025, we have engaged 14 employers who are offering job placements,” she said.
  “As of Friday and Saturday, a total of 318 candidates attended interview sessions, with 183 successfully securing jobs. Another 43 candidates are awaiting second interviews, which will be conducted at the respective employers’ premises,” she said when met here today.
  She added that among the top five employers offering the highest number of vacancies are Malayan Flour Mills Sdn Bhd, Malakoff Corporation Berhad, YTY Industry Sdn Bhd, Lagenda Properties Berhad, and KPJ Seri Manjung Specialist Hospital.
  “On the third day today, we are offering various job categories, including positions in the operations sector, manufacturing industry, professional roles, and service fields, particularly in delivery,” she said.
  Mageswari added that the categories of job applicants have also been expanded beyond just graduates and career switchers, to include PwDs and individuals aged 50 and above.
  “In fact, through MYFutureJobs, we have implemented initiatives nationwide. Many have participated, and we’ve brought programmes into rural and remote areas.
  “Therefore, we encourage the public to come forward and seize this opportunity. Now, it is up to them to secure the jobs being offered,” he said.
  Meanwhile, Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP) engineering graduate Muhammad Harun Hafiz Shaarani, 25, said the career carnival held at PMR 2025 in Perak was very helpful for him in his job search.
  Having graduated last year in electrical engineering, he took the opportunity to attend interview sessions offered by participating companies on the final day of PMR.
  “There are actually many job opportunities in Malaysia, we just need to explore them diligently.
  “In my opinion, the claim that there are no jobs is inaccurate. Perhaps students in this country need to be more strategic in choosing fields of study that align with national workforce needs,” he said.
  Perak is the second location to host the large-scale PMR initiative, a result of strategic collaboration between the Performance Acceleration Coordination Unit (PACU) of the Prime Minister’s Department, which serves as the main secretariat, and the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), as the lead ministry.

SEOUL, June 15 (Bernama-Yonhap) -- South Korea's exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries are on the rise, helping offset recent drops in shipments to the United States (US) and China amid a global trade war sparked partly by the US' evolving tariff policies, data showed Sunday.
  Yonhap News Agency reported that outbound shipments to the ASEAN region came to US$47.88 billion in the January-May period, up 4.3 per cent from the same period last year, according to data compiled by the Korea International Trade Association (KITA).
  Over the same period, South Korea's exports to the US went down 4.3 per cent as effects of the Donald Trump administration's tariff policies began to materialise, while shipments to China dropped 5 per cent.
  In February, exports to ASEAN economies recorded US$9.56 billion, surpassing monthly shipments to China, which stood at US$9.5 billion, for the first time in 23 years.
  Shipments to ASEAN exceeded those to China again in March, at US$10.26 billion to US$10.06 billion.
  In May, exports to the US decreased 8.4 per cent on-year to US$10.05 billion, while those to China contracted 8.1 per cent to US$10.4 billion due to the effects of the Trump administration's sweeping tariff policies. Shipments to ASEAN fell 1.3 per cent to US$10 billion in the month.
  The Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) earlier named ASEAN countries as favourable export destinations for South Korea this year amid the global trend to lower supply chain dependence on China, rapid growth of the digital economy and the expansion of middle-class households in the region.
  Promising export items to the region include semiconductors, electronics, home appliances, robots, EV battery parts, renewable energy facilities and others, according to KOTRA.
  "Amid the decoupling between the US and China, China is increasingly working to expand its presence in the ASEAN market. ASEAN will become a more important market in the future with the US, too, shifting its source of imports from China to ASEAN," said Austin Chang, president of the institute for international trade under KITA.

SEREMBAN, June 15 (Bernama) -- The relatively low level of health literacy among some Malaysians is one of the key reasons they avoid regular health screenings, including for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), cancer, and mental health issues, said Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad.
  He said most people only seek treatment when the disease has been identified or is at a more serious stage, rather than go for an early check-up.
  That is why, he said, it is important for the public to take care of their health and that of their family members by going for health screenings, followed by intervention and treatment.
  “This is why the Ministry of Health (MOH), under the National Health Screening Initiative (NHSI), emphasises screening, not only for NCDs, but also for cancer and mental health,” he told reporters after opening the Paroi constituency’s Healthy Mind Carnival, Prosperous Community here today.
  Also present was Negeri Sembilan Health Director Dr Zuraida Mohamed.
  Citing the latest National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS), Dzulkefly said that one in three adult Malaysians suffers from high blood pressure, one in three has high cholesterol, while one in six suffers from diabetes, with 50 per cent facing obesity.
  "That is why I want to see greater awareness about the importance of health screenings. I hope these efforts are well-received by the people. We have initiatives like Peka B40, Komuniti Sihat Pembina Negara (KOSPEN) and services at District Health Offices,” he said.
  Meanwhile, he said COVID-19 cases in the country are under control and below the national alert level, with an average of 600 cases per week.
  The Health Ministry, he said, will continue to monitor the situation.
  When asked about the need for Malaysians to get an additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccine following the increase in cases in a neighbouring country, he said there was no need to make it mandatory at this time, but advised the public to always take preventive measures.

SEREMBAN: Tahap kesedaran rakyat terhadap kepentingan saringan kesihatan berkala masih belum memuaskan disebabkan kelemahan dalam literasi kesihatan. 
  Menteri Kesihatan, Datuk Seri Dr. Dzulkefly Ahmad berkata, masih ramai yang tidak menjalani pemeriksaan kesihatan awal, termasuk dalam kalangan individu berumur 30 hingga 40 tahun, meskipun golongan tersebut berisiko menghidap penyakit tidak berjangkit (NCD).
  “Tidak begitu rendah tetapi saya masih mahu tahap kesedaran akan kepentingan saringan ditingkatkan lagi. Kita tidak boleh menunggu rakyat jatuh sakit baru bertindak. Ramai tidak tahu mereka berisiko kerana tidak pernah disaring,” katanya.
  Beliau berkata demikian kepada pemberita pada program Karnival Minda Sihat Komuniti Sejahtera Dewan Undangan Negeri (DUN) Paroi di Masjid Kariah Taman Bandar Senawang, di sini hari ini.
  Tambah beliau, tanggapan bahawa hanya individu yang sakit perlu ke klinik merupakan persepsi salah yang kerana boleh membawa kesan serius kerana penyakit selalunya dikesan lewat.
  Katanya, walaupun program saringan kesihatan seperti National Health Screening Initiative (NHSI) giat dijalankan namun menegaskan saringan tanpa susulan adalah tidak mencukupi.
  “Mereka yang dikesan sebagai pradiabetik, contohnya, perlu dibimbing untuk ubah gaya hidup. Bukan hanya diberitahu keputusan ujian dan dibiarkan begitu sahaja,” katanya.
  Menurutnya lagi, masih ramai tidak memahami konsep kesihatan menyeluruh yang merangkumi aspek kesihatan mental, pemakanan sihat, aktiviti fizikal dan pemantauan kesihatan secara berkala.
  “Kementerian Kesihatan kini sedang mempergiat usaha memperkasa literasi kesihatan melalui pelbagai inisiatif melibatkan komuniti, sekolah serta penyertaan aktif petugas kesihatan,” katanya. 
  Dalam perkembangan berkaitan, Dr. Dzulkefly berkata, pihak kementerian juga sedang menilai semula keperluan mengekalkan program vaksinasi Covid-19 bagi kumpulan rentan seperti warga emas, pesakit kanser dan penghidap penyakit kronik. – UTUSAN

（芙蓉15日讯）卫生部长拿督斯里
祖基菲里
指出，一些国人对
健康检查
重要性的
意识
仍偏低，是导致许多人未能定期进行健康检查的主要原因之一，包括非传染性疾病（NCD）、癌症及心理健康。
ADVERTISEMENT
他说，许多民众往往等到病情恶化或出现明显症状后才寻求治疗，而不是及早进行检查和预防。
因此，他呼吁民众应对自身及家庭成员的健康状况多加关注，积极进行健康检查，并在有需要时接受必要的介入与治疗。
他是于今日在森州芙蓉主持“心灵健康嘉年华”活动后，向媒体如是而言，出席者尚有森州卫生局局长祖莱达。
他指出，卫生部推动的全国健康检查计划（NHSI），不仅涵盖非传染性疾病，还将癌症和心理健康纳入检查项目。
“这与健康素养息息相关，许多国人因从未接受过健康检查，根本不知道自己患有糖尿病、高血压或高胆固醇，直到突然中风或心脏病发作才察觉，如今甚至有30至40岁的年轻人也面对这些风险。”
祖基菲里补充，根据国家健康及发病率调查报告（NHMS）数据显示，每三名成人中，就有一人患有高血压，每三人中有一人胆固醇过高，而每六人中就有一人患有糖尿病。此外，超过50％的国人面对肥胖问题。
“这就是为什么我们需要提升全民对健康检查重要性的认知，我们已推行各种计划，如B40群体健康关怀计划、‘社区健康，国家强盛’计划（KOSPEN），甚至各地区卫生办事处也在推动相关措施。”
祖基菲里（中）在芙蓉出席“心灵健康嘉年华”时，和民众一起参与“欢乐行”。（图：马新社）
另一方面，祖基菲里提到，国内的冠病疫情目前仍属可控范围，目前每周平均通报约600宗病例，仍低于国家警戒线。
针对是否有必要强制国人接种额外一剂冠病疫苗，他认为，目前尚没有此必要，不过，他呼吁民众继续遵守防疫措施。
“我们仍维持现有政策，鼓励高风险群体，尤其是从未接种疫苗者应考虑接种，但若说要强制全民接种额外疫苗，目前暂没有这样的政策。”

  He said the suspect, a private football trainer, was then arrested at about 7.30pm on Wednesday in the compound of his Bayu Damai home.
  “Urine test results came back negative for drugs.
  "However, checks found he has a record for an offence under Section 376 of the Penal Code (for rape),” he added.
  He said the Kota Tinggi Magistrate’s Court granted a six-day remand order against the suspect until Tuesday (June 17) to facilitate the investigation.
  “The case is being investigated under Section 14(a) of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017. If convicted, the suspect faces imprisonment for up to 20 years and caning,” he said.
  Supt Yusof urged anyone with information on the case to contact the nearest police station or the Kota Tinggi district police operations room at 07-883 7222.

GEORGE TOWN : Lebih 70,000 pemilik petak strata di Pulau Pinang kini berdepan risiko kehilangan milikan petak masing-masing.
  Situasi itu mungkin berlaku selepas Pejabat Tanah dan Galian (PTG) negeri merekodkan tunggakan cukai petak yang tinggi mencecah RM12.5 juta setakat 1 Jun lalu.
  Pengarah Tanah dan Galian Pulau Pinang, Dr. Faizal Kamarudin berkata, daerah Timur Laut mencatatkan jumlah tunggakan tertinggi, membabitkan 32,000 akaun cukai petak strata sejak cukai petak diperkenalkan pada tahun 2019.
  “Situasi ini amat membimbangkan kerana ia melibatkan jumlah pemilik petak yang besar dan 
  sekiranya tunggakan masih tidak dijelaskan, kita tiada pilihan selain mengeluarkan Notis Tuntutan Tunggakan Cukai Petak melalui Borang 11 di bawah Akta Hakmilik Strata 1985 kepada semua pemilik yang terlibat,” katanya kepada pemberita di sini, hari ini.
  Menurut Faizal, jika selepas tiga bulan daripada tarikh notis itu dikeluarkan masih tiada bayaran yang diterima pula, maka, tindakan perampasan di bawah Seksyen 23H Akta yang sama akan dilaksanakan. 
  “Ini bermaksud, petak strata tersebut akan dirampas dan menjadi milik Pihak Berkuasa Negeri,” ujar beliau.
  Jelasnya, majoriti tunggakan tersebut berlaku sejak enam tahun lalu dan beliau menyeru semua pemilik petak strata di Pulau Pinang supaya segera menjelaskan tunggakan masing-masing bagi mengelak tindakan undang-undang diambil.
  “Kami berharap agar semua pemilik petak strata di Pulau Pinang dapat membuat bayaran tunggakan cukai petak dengan segera bagi mengelakkan tindakan perampasan (forfeiture) di bawah seksyen 23H Akta Hakmilik Strata 1985 diambil terhadap mereka,” katanya.
  Tambah Faizal, pemilik yang mempunyai sebarang pertanyaan berkaitan perkara ini diminta segera berhubung dengan PTG Pulau Pinang atau mana-mana Pejabat Daerah dan Tanah berhampiran. – UTUSAN

GEORGE TOWN, June 15 — Penang recorded RM12.5 million in parcel rent arrears involving more than 70,000 strata parcels as of June 1, according to State Land and Mines Office director Dr Faizal Kamarudin.
  He said the majority of the arrears dated back to 2019, when parcel rent payments were first introduced for strata development schemes in the state.
  Faizal said the Timur Laut district recorded the highest amount of arrears, involving 32,000 accounts.
  “Failure to pay the arrears immediately may result in the issuance of a Notice of Demand via Form 11 under the Strata Titles Act 1985 to the parcel owners involved,” he said in a statement today.
  He added that if the strata parcel owner failed to settle the arrears in full within three months from the date the notice was issued, confiscation action could be taken under Section 23 of the same Act.
  Faizal said the enforcement action could be carried out by the land administrator, and ownership of the strata parcel would be transferred back to the state authority.
  Therefore, he urged all parcel owners involved to settle their parcel rent arrears immediately to avoid confiscation action.
  Strata parcel owners with further enquiries may contact the Penang Land and Mines Office or the respective District and Land Offices. — Bernama

进一步年轻化阵容的切尔西，欲在2025年世界球会杯刮起“青春风暴”。图示切尔西球队抵达美国时的画面。（法新社照片）
（亚特兰大15日综合电）在2025年世界球会杯首战面对东道主“菜鸟”洛杉矶FC，切尔西放眼取得开门红。
在美国举办的世界球会杯周一展开D组首轮竞逐，由英超“蓝狮”切尔西对阵美职联的洛杉矶FC。
ADVERTISEMENT
这将是切尔西队史第3度征战世界球会杯，曾于2021年赛会夺冠、2012年赛会居亚的蓝狮，此番是以2020/21赛季欧冠冠军之姿参战。
蓝狮冀刮起“青春风暴”
近年积极年轻化阵容的切尔西，日前再引进都是“00后”的“球二代”德拉普（22岁）、埃苏戈（20岁）、马马杜.萨尔（19岁）和门将彭德斯（19岁），将剑指在主帅马雷斯卡领军下，于世界球会杯刮起“青春风暴”。
马雷斯卡于赛前受访时认为，“经验仍然是优势，但我认为现在的趋势是年轻和活力更为重要。”
在未能及时引进法国国门迈尼昂后，切尔西于首战预料仍由西班牙人桑切斯把关，帕尔默、恩佐.费尔南德斯、卡塞多、里斯.詹姆斯等主力亦将披挂上阵。
通过入选赛获世界球会杯首秀机会的洛杉矶FC，阵中坐拥法国在2018年世界杯封王的2名主力——门将洛里和射脚吉鲁，前中北美冠军联赛和美职联金靴博安加（各赛事11球5助攻）也是切尔西重点提防对象。
宾菲加
博卡青年
争C组副盟
当天D组另一战，由前巴西球星菲利佩.路易斯掌帅、坐拥若日尼奥、达尼洛、桑德罗等前旅欧球星的巴甲劲旅弗拉门戈，应能顺利赢下突尼西亚的希望队。
而葡超劲旅宾菲加于C组对阵阿根廷豪门博卡青年，在德甲冠军拜仁慕尼黑备受看好占据该组正盟下，此役或将是提前上演的副盟争夺战。

阿尼西莫娃首胜郑钦文
在半决赛中，8号种子阿尼西莫娃以6比2、4比6、6比4击败头号种子郑钦文，在双方的3次交锋中取得首胜，本周连克两位世界前10，首次闯入草地决赛。
ADVERTISEMENT
谈及第3盘第6局时的换鞋暂停，郑钦文无奈地表示，她第一盘时已经觉得鞋有点问题，但后来才发现鞋底板开胶，只能换上前一比赛日让她多次滑倒的鞋。上轮直落两盘战胜拉杜卡努的比赛中，郑钦文穿的鞋连续打滑，于是中途换鞋。
尽管职业生涯首进草地赛事4强后未能继续突破，但郑钦文还是为自己逆境下的坚持感到满意。（美联社照片）
郑钦文：比赛中更多在思考鞋子
郑钦文说：“这双鞋是我当年打青少年比赛时留下的草地鞋，虽然是新的，但很多年没有用过。今天底板开胶，我也是完全没有想到。”
由于赞助商未能及时把新的草场鞋寄到她手中，郑钦文不得不再换上防滑效果不理想的旧鞋，坚持完成了比赛。她坦言，比赛中“更多在思考鞋子，没法专注在网球上面”。
她还透露，自己球包里一般有4把球拍，其中两把有更高磅数，当日开场后想用磅数更高的球拍却发现没带，第2盘才拿到手。“其实这些小细节都需要注意，草地上进程快，对拍子磅数会敏感一些，以后还是要更好准备。”
尽管职业生涯首进草场赛事4强后未能继续突破，但22岁的郑钦文她的即时排名来到世界第4，刷新个人生涯纪录。
玛利亚首进WTA500赛决赛
阿尼西莫娃将在决赛对阵玛利亚，后者以6比3、7比6（3）挑落美国2号种子凯斯，从入选赛开始连赢6场，连克3位世界第14、第11和第8位的前15球员，职业生涯迄今闯入最高级别争冠战。

LUMUT, June 15 (Bernama) -- The Information Department (JaPen) must disseminate information on key government policies to MADANI Communities within 24 hours of their announcement, said Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil.
  He said the move is crucial to ensure that all 1,878 MADANI Communities nationwide receive accurate and verified information promptly.
  “So, the task I have given the Information Department is to ensure that MADANI Communities become the first group to receive accurate information on any announced policy.
  “It’s a heavy responsibility, but this is our (JaPen’s) role moving forward,” he said at the Northern Zone B Akademi Asas (ASAS) programme organised by JaPen at Universiti Kuala Lumpur Malaysian Institute of Marine Engineering Technology (UniKL-MIMET) here today.
  Also present were Communications Ministry secretary-general Datuk Mohamad Fauzi Md Isa and JaPen director-general Julina Johan.
  Fahmi, who is also MADANI government spokesperson, said there is ample room for JaPen to enhance the way it communicates information to the public, adding that he has discussed with the department’s management the best mechanisms to be implemented as early as next week.
  “I believe the District Information Offices (PPD) will certainly carry out their duties well. All of us must work very hard to ensure that the MADANI Communities under our care consistently receive accurate information,” he said.
  Earlier, Fahmi met with nearly 150 MADANI Community members from Perak and Penang in conjunction with the ASAS programme.
  Meanwhile, in a statement, JaPen said this edition of ASAS focuses on activating social media use among MADANI Communities to disseminate verified and up-to-date government information.
  “This focus aims to make social media a strategic tool to counter false and misleading narratives that could threaten social harmony and national stability,” the statement said.
  JaPen stated that to date, a total of 373 short videos explaining various current issues have been uploaded by MADANI Communities across various social media platforms as part of efforts to broaden access to accurate information.
  Based on a Training of Trainers (ToT) concept, it said the ASAS module was developed to ensure MADANI Community members can serve as Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) within their respective communities.
  “This includes the ability to explain current issues through social media effectively and in line with the current digital communication landscape,” the statement added.

“虽然有反对党议员叫我做‘厕所首相’，没关系。厕所问题是真实存在的问题。”

安华强烈谴责近期对伊朗展开袭击的以色列，称怎么会有国家如以色列般无礼、恶劣和疯狂。
他也指出，虽然许多伊斯兰国家富有、拥有10亿名穆斯林，但勇于捍卫伊朗的不多；他则向内阁表示，马来西亚是独立国家，必须捍卫朋友包括伊朗的权利，也支持伊朗反击捍卫尊严的权利。
他表示，当以色列袭击伊朗，许多欧洲国家保持沉默，但当伊朗反击，这些国家就回击，他不赞成这样的立场，并强调昌明大马政府维护所有国家的权利。

LUMUT, June 15 — Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim today urged all ministers, senior federal and state government officials, as well as policy and project implementers, to frequently engage with the public to better understand the issues faced by the people.
  The Prime Minister said members of parliament should also adopt this approach to ensure local concerns are addressed more effectively and comprehensively.
  “Even senior civil servants are requested to go to the ground, which is why we have initiatives like Sejati Madani and Kampung Angkat Madani. These enable senior officials, including ministers, to identify any disconnect between policy statements and their implementation at the grassroots level.
  “When we engage at the ground level, we discuss issues like education, unemployment, drug abuse, healthcare facilities and economic projects. All these must be addressed thoroughly because the challenges reported may differ between federal and state levels,” he said.

  Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said this at the closing of the Perak-level MADANI Rakyat Programme (PMR) 2025 held at Lumut Waterfront here today.
  Anwar stressed the importance of directly listening to the people’s grievances through initiatives like the MADANI Rakyat programme or dialogue sessions between leaders and the public to gather feedback on areas needing improvement in development projects.
  Citing examples, Anwar said he learned about issues such as damaged toilets in many schools and limited internet access in higher education institutions (IPT) through interactions with the public during community engagement programmes at eateries or Friday prayers.
  He said such grassroots engagement allows the government to act swiftly in addressing these problems.
  “We talk about artificial intelligence (AI), digitalisation, Microsoft and so on, but we still have broken toilets and no internet access. This is a major contradiction because while we want to prepare for an advanced future, basic infrastructure must be resolved first,” he said.
  Also present at the closing ceremony were Perak Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Saarani Mohamad and Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, representing the lead ministry.
  Among others present were Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil, Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Shamsul Azri Abu Bakar, and senior federal and state officials.
  The three-day Perak PMR 2025 marked the second large-scale edition of the programme, held through strategic collaboration between the Performance Acceleration and Coordination Unit (PACU) under the Prime Minister’s Department as the lead secretariat, and the Higher Education Ministry as the main implementing agency.
  PMR 2025 is held in both large and small-scale formats, with the first large-scale edition held in Tawau, Sabah from May 9 to 11.

LUMUT, June 15 (Bernama) -- Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim today urged all ministers, senior federal and state government officials, as well as policy and project implementers, to frequently engage with the public to better understand the issues faced by the people.
  The Prime Minister said members of parliament should also adopt this approach to ensure local concerns are addressed more effectively and comprehensively.
  “Even senior civil servants are requested to go to the ground, which is why we have initiatives like Sejati MADANI and Kampung Angkat MADANI. These enable senior officials, including ministers, to identify any disconnect between policy statements and their implementation at the grassroots level.
  “When we engage at the ground level, we discuss issues like education, unemployment, drug abuse, healthcare facilities and economic projects. All these must be addressed thoroughly because the challenges reported may differ between federal and state levels,” he said.
  Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said this at the closing of the Perak-level MADANI Rakyat Programme (PMR) 2025 held at Lumut Waterfront here today.
  Anwar stressed the importance of directly listening to the people’s grievances through initiatives like the MADANI Rakyat programme or dialogue sessions between leaders and the public to gather feedback on areas needing improvement in development projects.

(Reuters) -BT Group Chief Executive Allison Kirkby said advances in artificial intelligence could deepen significant job cuts under way at the British telecoms company, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
  Kirkby told the newspaper that BT's plans to cull more than 40,000 jobs and strip out 3 billion pounds ($4 billion) of costs by the end of the decade "did not reflect the full potential of AI".
  "Depending on what we learn from AI . . . there may be an opportunity for BT to be even smaller by the end of the decade," the FT quoted her as saying.
  Britain's biggest broadband and mobile provider had said in 2023 it would cut as many as 55,000 jobs, including contractors, by 2030, with then-CEO Philip Jansen saying the company would rely on a much smaller workforce and significantly reduced cost base by the end of the 2020s.
  Kirkby, who took over from Jansen a year ago, has also opened the door to a possible future spin-off of Openreach, the company's network infrastructure business, the FT said.
  She said she did not feel the value of Openreach was reflected in the company's share price and if that persisted, BT "would absolutely have to look at options".
  BT said last month that strong demand for fibre broadband and more than 900 million pounds of cost savings had helped shore up its full-year earnings and boost cash flow. 
  Resilience at Openreach offset declines in revenue and profits in its business and consumer units, where legacy voice services continued to wane and handset sales fell.

（华盛顿15日综合电）《华尔街日报》报道，中国

企业为规避美国
晶片

，公司旗下的工程师将数据存在
硬碟
，将硬碟携带至可获取
辉达
（NVIDIA）晶片的国家，在他国训练完AI模型后带回中国。
报道说，美国自2022年起以维护国安为由，收紧向中国销售高端AI晶片和其他技术的相关限制，中企过去也以各种方法绕过限制，包括透过第三国将AI（人工智慧）相关硬体设备走私到中国。不过，业内人士表示，因美国施压，这种做法的难度越来越大。
ADVERTISEMENT
有些中企最近采取其他方式规避管制，将数据转移至中国境外，在东南亚和中东等地使用美国的AI晶片。
报道提到，今年3月初，有4名中国工程师飞往马来西亚，每人都携带一个装有15颗硬碟的行李箱。这些硬碟中存储80TB的电子表格、图像和影片片段，用于训练AI模型。
这群工程师的雇主在一家马来西亚数据中心租用300台装有辉达高阶AI晶片的伺服器，工程师将数据输入至伺服器，在数据中心训练AI模型。他们最近带着数百GB计的数据，包括指导AI系统输出的模型参数回到中国。
参与这项计划的消息人士透露，公司为这次前往马来西亚的行动筹备数月，工程师们花费超过8周的时间优化数据、调整AI训练程式，并携带硬碟搭机入境。
报道说，这群中国工程师去年也曾接洽过同一家马来西亚数据中心，当时是透过一家新加坡子公司进行。随着辉达及供应商开始对AI晶片的最终用户进行更严格的审核，这家马来西亚数据中心要求中企透过马来西亚实体进行操作，降低监管审查风险。根据公司注册文件显示，这家中企在吉隆坡注册一家实体。
这一类数据中心在东南亚迅速涌现，为西方和中国客户提供服务。近几个月各公司纷纷抢购由辉达和超微（Advanced Micro Devices）开发的晶片，安装在东南亚的数据中心。
台湾国际贸易署的数据显示，马来西亚在3月和4月从台湾进口价值34亿美元（143.97亿令吉）的AI晶片和其他处理器，超过此类晶片在2024年的进口总额。
知情人士透露，今年一家总部位在北京的科技公司接手马来西亚一家数据中心200台AI伺服器的租约，这些伺服器之前是一家美国云端运算公司预留的。
此外，有些业内人士认为，中东地区也很可能成为中国AI开发者的目的地。美国总统特朗普日前访问中东，辉达宣布向沙地阿拉伯、卡塔尔、阿联酋出售数十万枚AI晶片。

台湾前总统马英九（左）在第17届海峡论坛的论坛大会之前，与大陆全国政协主席王沪宁会面。（互联网照片）
（15日综合电）台湾前总统
马英九
第4次访问大陆，他今日出席第17届
海峡论坛
的论坛大会前，与全国政协主席王沪宁会面时表示，中共中央总书记
习近平
对于两岸和平发展的努力，以及对两岸青年未来的关切，都让他印象深刻而且感动。
马英九此行是应大陆方面邀请，于本月14日至27日率马英九基金会“大九学堂”学员至福建参加海峡论坛，随后赴甘肃出席“两岸共同弘扬中华文化”活动、“2025年公祭中华人文始祖伏羲大典”并走访河西走廊。
ADVERTISEMENT
马英九一行昨午抵达厦门，当日没对媒体公开行程。马英九在福建期间，除了出席于厦门举办的海峡论坛之外，还将访问宁德、福州等地。
论坛大会开始前，王沪宁早上与马英九会面。与会的还有国民党大陆事务部主任林祖嘉、马英九基金会执行长萧旭岑、马前总统办公室主任王光慈，以及政治大学荣誉教授邱坤玄，还有新党主席吴成典等人参加会见。
大陆方面，陪同王沪宁出席会见的有国台办主任宋涛、副主任潘贤掌、副主任赵世通、海协会会长张志军、福建省委书记周祖翼。
马英九说：“今天来到福建厦门参加第17届海峡论坛活动，我感到非常荣幸与高兴，我也要特别谢谢王沪宁主席，去年2024年4月，我第2次访问大陆的时候，在北京人民大会堂跟习近平总书记会面，习总书记对于两岸和平发展的努力，以及对两岸青年未来的关切，都让我印象深刻而且感动。也请王主席代我转达对习总书记的问候。当前两岸情势确实存在不确定性与挑战，但是越是这样的时刻，越需要保持理性与冷静的态度，越需要以交流促进了解”，马英九强调，他始终保持坚定的信心，深信未来
两岸关系
发展的关键在于民心向背。
马英九说，中国5000年历史合久必分，分久必合，台湾民众渴望两岸朝向和平的“和”跟合作的“合”的方向。今年5月以来，台湾各项民调显示，多数台湾人民支持两岸的和平与合作，认同两岸都是炎黄子孙，彼此血缘相依、情感共通，始终是台湾绝对的主流民意。
马英九强调，海峡两岸在1992年达成各自以口头声明的方式表达一个中国的原则的共识，符合历史与各自法律的规定，也兼顾了海峡两岸人民的利益与福祉。“我衷心的期盼，两岸在九二共识、反对台独的基础上，进一步深化合作，用交流取代对抗，用协商取代冲突，尽一切的力量避免战祸，共同致力于振兴中华，才能让彼此有更安全、更美好的未来。”
马英九指出，两岸关系的和平发展是两岸人民共同的期望，也是两岸的最大利益。经过多年以来的交流与互动，我们可以看到，即使两岸存在一些差异，但两岸人民之间的感情以及对交流的渴望始终没有中断，在这些民间不懈的努力下，我们能够持续寻求理解，建立互信，逐步推动正向的发展。
这已不是马王二人首次见面。马英九在去年4月间第2次访问大陆期间，曾在北京人民大会堂举行“马习二会”，当时王沪宁等人都有出席；当晚，王沪宁于钓鱼台国宾馆设宴宴请马英九。

SINGAPORE: One in four young people here say they have hurt themselves at least once in their lives, in ways such as cutting or punching themselves.
  This was the finding of a recent study that shed new light on the prevalence and patterns of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among young people in Singapore.
  NSSI typically includes cutting, burning, hitting or otherwise inflicting physical harm.
  The study found that the median age that NSSI behaviour starts was 14, while males had a second peak at around 18 years of age.
  Repetitive NSSI, defined as at least five instances of self-harm, was reported by 11.6 per cent of respondents.
  The most common method of self-injury in the study was cutting, which was prevalent among almost 13.5 per cent of young people. This was followed by severe scratching, punching themselves and banging their heads against something
  The study, published in March, took data from the National Youth Mental Health Study, which involved 2,600 participants aged 15 to 35. The national study was conducted by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).
  Dr Swapna Verma, chairman of the medical board at IMH, told The Straits Times that NSSI is not a mental disorder but a behaviour that often signals underlying issues.
  “Young people may resort to self-harm as a way to cope with overwhelming emotions or distress that they don’t have the tools to manage in healthier ways.
  “For some, it provides a temporary relief from intense feelings like sadness, anger, anxiety or numbness. Others may use it to communicate distress.”
  The study highlighted certain risk factors associated with self-harm.
  Females were twice as likely as males to engage in self-injury. IMH senior research officer Sherilyn Chang said that though some studies show NSSI to be more prevalent among females, research on gender differences in NSSI prevalence remains mixed.
  “A reason for higher odds in females could be that females tend to experience greater levels of psychological distress, and this in turn is associated with higher odds of NSSI.”
  Some studies have reported that females often try to manage their emotions more than males, she said.
  “However, this increased attention on regulating emotions can sometimes have the opposite effect, especially if it involves overthinking or dwelling on negative feelings. Over time, the distress is sustained or intensified and may lead to NSSI behaviour.”
  Young people aged 15 to 29 and those with lower educational attainment also reported higher odds of self-injury, and those experiencing severe or extremely severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were more likely to engage in the behaviour.
  Those who had body image dissatisfaction were twice as likely to engage in NSSI than those who were not.
  Chang said: “It is suggested that individuals with body dissatisfaction develop a disregard for their body and may be indifferent about protecting it, along with an increased tolerance for pain.
  “Such indifference and disregard for their body facilitates individuals in engaging in self-injurious behaviours when they face intense emotional distress.”
  Although about one in four young people have hurt themselves at some point in their lives, far fewer reported having done so in the past 12 months.
  Researchers suggest this may be due to older participants outgrowing the behaviour, developing healthier coping strategies, or receiving professional help over time.
  Given that NSSI begins early at the median age of 14 and its overlap with the schooling years, researchers from the study stressed the importance of training school personnel like teachers and counsellors to recognise and appropriately respond to signs of self-harm.
  They also called for more preventive programmes to focus on reducing the start of self-injurious behaviours. This could include programmes aimed at enhancing resilience in young people or teaching healthier coping strategies that can help them regulate their emotions.
  Currently, mental health education lessons in the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum aim to equip students with knowledge and skills to manage their emotions, differentiate normal stress from distress or mental illnesses, and to seek help when needed.
  It is also important to improve awareness and knowledge of the issue on a broader societal level, researchers said, as self-harming behaviour is often associated with shame and stigma, and young people may often choose to keep quiet about it.
  Dr Swapna said parents and caregivers may not realise that it is an issue, as teenagers tend to hide their self-harm, often carrying it out in secrecy due to shame or fear of disapproval.
  Knowing more about non-suicidal self-injury and the warning signs to look out for, like unexplained cuts or bruises, frequent isolation, or sudden mood changes, can help parents and caregivers respond more appropriately, she added.
  “Invalidating the young person’s struggles or being judgmental strains the relationship and may be distressing to someone already struggling with self-harm.
  “Instead, it is important to create a space where the teen feels safe to talk, to listen without judgment, and to help him or her acquire new skills to process and regulate emotions, and cope with stressors.” - The Straits Times/ANN

SINGAPORE, June 15 — A quarter of young people in Singapore have deliberately hurt themselves at least once in their lives, often by cutting, scratching or punching themselves, according to a national study that sheds light on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI).
  The findings, from the National Youth Mental Health Study by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and published in The Straits Times today, involved 2,600 participants aged 15 to 35 and were published in March. NSSI typically begins at a median age of 14, with a second peak among males around 18.
  While not classified as a mental disorder, NSSI is often a sign of deeper emotional struggles. 
  “Young people may resort to self-harm as a way to cope with overwhelming emotions or distress that they don’t have the tools to manage in healthier ways,” Dr Swapna Verma, chairman of the IMH medical board, reportedly said.
  “For some, it provides temporary relief from intense feelings like sadness, anger, anxiety or numbness. Others may use it to communicate distress.”
  About 11.6 per cent had engaged in repetitive self-harm, defined as five or more instances. Cutting was the most common method, reported by nearly 13.5 per cent, followed by scratching, punching, and head-banging.
  Girls were twice as likely as boys to self-harm. IMH senior research officer Sherilyn Chang said females tend to experience greater psychological distress, which may account for the higher rates.
  “It is suggested that individuals with body dissatisfaction develop a disregard for their body and may be indifferent about protecting it, along with an increased tolerance for pain.
  “Such indifference and disregard for their body facilitates individuals in engaging in self-injurious behaviours when they face intense emotional distress,” she said.
  Other risk factors included being aged 15 to 29, lower educational attainment, severe depression or anxiety, and body dissatisfaction. Those unhappy with their body image were twice as likely to self-harm.
  Though one in four reported self-harming at some point, fewer said they had done so in the past year — possibly due to maturing, healthier coping, or receiving help.
  Researchers urged schools to step up early intervention, given the behaviour typically begins during the school years. They recommended training teachers and counsellors to spot warning signs and respond appropriately.
  They also called for preventive programmes to build resilience and teach healthier emotional coping. Mental health education is currently included in the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum.
  Beyond schools, the researchers stressed the need for greater public awareness, noting that stigma often keeps young people from speaking up.
  Dr Swapna said many parents may be unaware of their children’s self-harm, as it is usually kept secret. 
  “Invalidating the young person’s struggles or being judgmental strains the relationship,” she said.
  “Instead, it is important to create a space where the teen feels safe to talk, to listen without judgment, and to help him or her acquire new skills to process and regulate emotions, and cope with stressors.”

黄龙豪辞去设施管理工作，放弃收入、社交和个人生活，成了儿子的全职看护者。（取自8视界新闻网）
（新加坡15日讯）为了照顾患有
肌肉萎缩症
的
儿子
，59岁的黄龙豪5年前辞去工作，成了
全职照护
者。他放下工作，放下社交，即使没有朋友作伴，他也选择日夜守在儿子身边，无怨无悔。
《8视界新闻网》报道，现年38岁的黄威翔，15岁时患上肌肉萎缩症。2019年圣诞前夕，他因严重肺部感染住院两个多月，期间多次进出加护病房，命悬一线。
回忆那段日子，
父亲
黄龙豪眼眶泛红地说：“当时最危险的时候有十多名医生和护士抢救，两三架机器推进ICU。我接到女儿电话只能强忍着哭，说没事没事，后面直接哭了出来。”
那阵子，黄龙豪每天守在病房12小时，看着儿子插着呼吸管，心如刀割。从那年起，他毅然辞去设施管理工作，放弃收入、社交和个人生活，成了日以继夜的全职看护者。
“钱是赚不完的，顾他重要，我儿子平安就好。”

每日重复的守护 5年不曾松懈
记者早前登门拜访时，家中情景令人动容。黄威翔躺卧在床，戴着呼吸辅助器，父亲黄龙豪则熟练地操作医疗设备，为他量体温、抽痰、按摩身体等，每一个动作都娴熟而有条理。
喂奶、喂药、刷牙，甚至协助如厕与行动，这些都是黄龙豪每天的照护流程。从床上抱到轮椅，这个费力动作，他每天至少重复五六次，5年来从不间断。
黄龙豪表示，儿子的肌肉萎缩情况比较严重，身子也越来越弱，只有手部可以轻微活动，其余则需要依赖他人协助完成。因为如此，黄龙豪就算出门买饭，也不敢离开超过20分钟。
“家里没有人顾他，所以发生什么事情也没有人知道，机器那些像呼吸机有时候会跳脱，所以不放心。”
24小时待命、形影不离，是否失去了个人生活？59岁的黄龙豪坦言，他早已习惯。“我是没有朋友的，因为需要顾孩子，尤其是我儿子这样的情形，我什么人都没有结交了，重点是顾我儿子。”
他还说：“要顾他，什么东西都要放弃，包括我的护照已经逾期两年多了，我也没有换新的。因为顾他就是要顾好来，什么东西都不用想。”
他轻描淡写的一句话，道尽沉重而日复一日的责任。

父亲 是他心中不倒的英雄
在儿子黄威翔心中，父亲不仅是家人，更是生命中的英雄。他受访时坦言，住院病危时父亲曾对他说：“如果你放弃，我也会放弃。”正是这句话，让他下定决心努力康复。
“其实我心中蛮（感动的），他好像是一个英雄这样。他看到我太危急很担心，就跟老板说暂时不做了，从那时候开始一直照顾我，直到现在。”
谈到父亲为他付出的一切，他满怀感激：“真的除了感谢，还是感谢。有这样的英雄陪在我身边。”

因容易爆炸，北京多所高校已禁用罗马仕充电宝。（互联网照片）
（
北京
15日综合电）北京多所高校发布通知，基于罗马仕
充电宝
存在爆炸风险，禁止学生在校园内使用这个品牌产品。罗马仕也因此向公众致歉，并承诺如果产品被权威机构鉴定为有缺陷，公司将依法承担全部责任。
综合《南方都市报》和《紫牛新闻》报道，北京部分高校发通知提醒学生，近期发现20000毫安的罗马仕牌充电器在充电时，相比于其他品牌型号充电器，更容易发生爆炸现象。
ADVERTISEMENT
通知截图显示，上级主管部门要求师生及时排查个人所用充电宝是否为这个品牌型号，并建议尽快停止使用，以防发生危险。
北京联合大学学生处工作人员说，学校近期发生过相关品牌型号充电宝自爆自燃事件。这款充电宝的自燃风险较高，消防部门曾向学校发出安全提醒和建议，传媒大学也出现过同款充电宝自燃案例，处理时需投放有害垃圾桶。
北京工业大学耿丹学院保卫处工作人员透露，已收到市教委关于该问题的安全提醒。
网购平台显示，罗马仕20000毫安充电宝在手机移动电源热销榜上，价格约人民币100元（58.95令吉），销量表现良好。
罗马仕周六在官方微博发布声明，就事件给师生及公众带来的困扰致以诚挚歉意，并承诺“任何经权威机构鉴定存在缺陷的罗马仕产品，我们将依法承担全部责任”。
罗马仕说，公司高度重视此事，已展开核查，且与北京市教育委员会在内相关部门取得沟通。截至公告发布，公司并未收到北京市教育委员会的风险通告。

说起
旅行
，不管男女老幼，应该都会心生向往。
有能力的家庭，孩子从小就有机会去旅游，不管是在国内还是国外。反之，那些童年时家庭条件有限的孩子，长大后踏入社会，有了收入，也会想靠自己努力实现旅行梦，开拓视野。
ADVERTISEMENT
不少子女会趁父母身体仍然健壮时，带他们出外走走，不一定要飞得多远，只希望能陪爸妈一起看看这个世界，留下一些珍贵的回忆。
疫情前，我也会与父母和长辈们去旅行，疫情后停顿了数年，加上长辈们年纪渐长和行动不便，对出游兴趣缺缺。
前阵子，我再度带母亲到中国自助旅行，由于她膝关节退化，步履缓慢，于是我事前规划了一趟“少走动又轻松”的旅程。选择住在交通便利的酒店，附近有餐厅、商场和步行街等。当感到疲累时，随时都能回酒店休息，每天只安排一至三个轻松的行程，陪她慢慢地走，让她可以悠哉地体会旅程乐趣。
在机场登机时，我看到一对年轻夫妇，带著三名年幼的孩子和两名坐轮椅的长辈同行。他们获得优先登机，抵达目的地后我又在当地巧遇他们。原来他们全程包车出行，有专车接送，不但节省体力，也免去舟车劳顿之苦，这样贴心的安排，换来一家三代温馨又安心的旅行体验。
其实，带长辈出游，最重要的是舒适陪伴，而非密集的行程。若长者行动较缓，建议避开需长时间步行的地点。
行程方面可以做出弹性的安排，一天只规划一至三个重点活动已足够，并可依照长辈的兴趣来安排。例如若喜欢美食与风景，可早上参观寺庙或景点，中午享用午餐后逛逛街，下午回酒店小憩，晚上再出外用餐或欣赏夜景。
带父母出游，子女的角色应该是陪伴者，给他们多一点耐心，多一句鼓励，让他们可以好好享受这段旅程。
平日与旅伴出游，往往步伐匆匆，从早到晚至少行走两万步。但这一次，当放慢了脚步，让我对旅行有另一番感悟。原来，慢行，会有另一种深刻与感触。
当父母还能走、还能看、还能笑时，不妨放下日常的忙碌，如果他们愿意出门，就陪他们一起看看这个世界，在有限的岁月里，留下无可取代的回忆。

每个城市都有属于自己的“味道”，而在巴生味道的代名词非肉骨茶莫属。走在巴生街头巷尾，各式各样的肉骨茶店如繁星点点，从老字号到新潮风格，从清晨5时营业到夜晚打烊，几乎每个时段、每个角落都能找到属于肉骨茶的“据点”。
ADVERTISEMENT
更难得的是，巴生的肉骨茶从来不只有一种模样，有瓦煲肉骨茶、碗装肉骨茶、干肉骨茶、鸡骨茶、海鲜肉骨茶及素骨茶等，各有各的粉丝群、各有各的滋味。
有人喜欢用砂煲慢炖出汤底的香浓，有人偏爱干式肉骨茶的香辣入味，也有人钟情清淡汤头配油条的吃法。在巴生，不同风味的肉骨茶就像城市的缩影，丰富、多元，又不失其根本。
肉骨茶不仅是巴生人引以为傲的地方美食，更是一种生活态度。这里不仅有游客慕名而来，更有有本地人将肉骨茶融入生命的节奏。
我认识的一名市议员，数十年如一日坚持早餐吃肉骨茶，无论公事多繁忙，从不跳过这一餐。他说，即便身在外地，甚至国外，也要设法寻找肉骨茶的踪迹；若实在找不到，一回到巴生，隔天早上第一件事就是冲到肉骨茶店“报到”。
他说，一天不吃肉骨茶，就觉得浑身不对劲。这听来虽近痴迷，却也点出了一个事实：对不少巴生人来说，肉骨茶不是奢侈享受，而是一种日常的安稳感，是味蕾的依赖，更是对城市身份的认同。
或许，正是这一碗碗看似平凡的肉骨茶，承载着的是巴生人的烟火气与归属感——让人即使走得再远，心里那股“想回家吃肉骨茶”的念头，始终浓得像汤，不散。

TAIPEI: Taiwan's government has added China's Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) to its export control list, which includes other proscribed organisations like the Taliban and al Qaeda.
  Inclusion on the economy ministry's trade administration's strategic high-tech commodities entity list means Taiwanese companies will need government approval before exporting any products to the companies.
  The companies were included in an updated version of the ministry's trade administration's website late on Saturday (June 14). Neither company nor the economy ministry immediately responded to requests for comment outside of office hours at the weekend.
  Taiwan is home to TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier of chips to AI darling Nvidia. Both Huawei and SMIC have been working hard to catch up in the chip technology race.
  Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory despite the strong objections of Taipei's government, already has tight chip export controls when it comes to Taiwanese companies either manufacturing in the country or supplying Chinese firms.
  Huawei, which is at the centre of China's AI ambitions, is on a US Commerce Department trade list that essentially bars it from receiving US goods and technology, as well as foreign-made goods such as chips from companies like TSMC made with US technology.
  Last October, TechInsights, a Canadian tech research firm, took apart Huawei's 910B AI processor and found a TSMC chip in it. The multi-chip 910B is viewed as the most advanced AI accelerator mass-produced by a Chinese company.
  TSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo, whose chip matched the one in the Huawei 910B and, in November the US Commerce Department ordered TSMC to halt shipments of more chips to Chinese customers.
  Taiwan's government has also repeatedly vowed to crack down on what it says are efforts by Chinese companies, including SMIC, to steal technology and entice chip talent away from the island.
  SMIC is China's largest chipmaker and has ramped up investment to expand production capacity and strengthen China's domestic semiconductor capability in the face of sweeping US export controls. - Reuters

华为和中芯国际遭到台湾实施技术出口管制。（互联网照片）
（台北15日综合电）彭博社报道，台湾已将中国大陆研发尖端人工智能（

晶片
的核心企业
华为
和
中芯国际
列入
出口黑名单
。
报道说，台湾经济部国际贸易署网站昨天公布的“战略性高科技货品实体清单”更新版本显示，华为、中芯国际及麾下多家子公司被列入清单，其中包括华为多家在日本、俄罗斯和德国的海外子公司。
ADVERTISEMENT
目前，台湾官方未对外宣布这一变动。
根据现行规定，台湾企业如果向清单上的实体出口相关产品，必须事先获得政府批准。
这次新出台的管制措施，预计将部分切断华为与中芯国际获取台湾关键技术、材料与设备的渠道。这些资源对建设晶片工厂、生产AI晶片至关重要，其中包括台积电为英伟达客户代工的高端晶片所依赖的相关工艺。
之前，华为与中芯国际及部分子公司已被美国列入实体清单，严重限制了它们获取外国技术的能力。
虽然台湾多年来禁止向中国大陆出口光刻机关键晶片制造设备，不过之前从未将中国大陆主要科技企业或晶片制造商列入实体清单。2020年，作为苹果和英伟达的主要晶片供应商，台积电因美国出口管制停止向华为供货。
尽管受到多方限制，华为与中芯国际在2023年联合推出一款先进的国产7纳米晶片，震动美国政界。
彭博社曾在2023年报道，多家台湾企业在协助华为在中国大陆南部秘密建设一批晶片工厂。

PETALING JAYA: Residential properties sold under the Housing Development Act (HDA) are exempt from the Sales and Services Tax (SST), says Nga Kor Ming.
  The Housing and Local Government Minister explained the SST exemption is determined by either the land title or the intended use of the property.
  "This means all residential buildings, including serviced apartments on commercial titles, are exempt from SST, as long as they are intended for residential use and fall under the purview of the HDA," he said in a statement on Sunday (June 15).
  Nga made this statement following a consultation with Finance Minister II Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan, in response to feedback from industry stakeholders expressing concerns about the updated SST framework.
  He added that the issue of cascading taxes was addressed through a Business-to-Business (B2B) exemption, ensuring that service tax is imposed at only one level.
  According to the Finance Ministry, basic construction materials such as cement, aggregates, and sand remain subject to 0% sales tax.
  Out of 400 tariff codes applicable to building materials, sales tax has been increased for only eight, covering items such as vats, laminated glass, and netting.
  This will affect only 2% of the total building material tariff codes.
  Contractors may choose to separate material costs from service charges, allowing the service tax to apply solely to construction services.
  Nga added his ministry remains committed to continuous engagement with the Finance Ministry and other key stakeholders to ensure fair implementation of tax policies, safeguard the interests of homebuyers, and support a stable, sustainable housing sector.
  "In line with the Madani aspirations, the Housing and Local Government Ministry remains committed to preserving housing affordability and protecting homebuyers' interests under the revised SST framework," he added.

倪可敏是在与第二财政部长拿督斯里阿米尔韩查进行磋商后作出上述宣布，以回应业界对SST框架更新的疑虑。

倪可敏表示，SST豁免依据房产地契类型或房产用途而定，即只要用于住宅用途，并受房屋发展法令监管的住宅房产——包括在商业地契下的服务式公寓——皆可豁免销售税。
倪可敏指出，针对“重复征税”的问题，政府将通过企业对企业（B2B）机制应对，确保SST仅在单一层面征收，以避免重复征税。
“根据财政部数据，水泥、骨料、沙等基本建筑材料仍维持0%销售税；在涵盖建筑材料的400个税则编码中，仅有8项材料（如大桶、夹层玻璃、网片等）税率有所上调，仅占住宅建筑材料总数的2%。”
“承包商也可将建筑材料与建筑服务分开列账，仅对建筑服务部分征收服务税。”
倪可敏表示，房地部将持续与财政部及业界紧密合作，确保新的税务政策在保护购屋者权益的同时，也推动我国房地产市场稳定与可持续发展。
“我们将继续贯彻‘居者有其屋’的宏愿，确保全马购屋者在新的SST税务框架下，权益受到保护。”

Only 2% of building material tariff codes are affected by the SST hike, according to the housing and local government ministry.
PETALING JAYA
:
The housing and local government ministry has clarified that residential properties sold under the Housing Development Act (HDA) remain exempt from the expanded sales and service tax (SST).
Minister Nga Kor Ming said this covers all residential buildings, including serviced apartments with commercial land titles, provided they are intended for residential use and fall under the scope of the HDA.
“The SST exemption is determined by either the land title or the intended use of the property,” he said in a statement today after consulting with finance minister II Amir Hamzah Azizan.
The clarification comes after receiving feedback from industry players about the expanded SST framework that begins from July 1 and its possible impact on housing costs.
Groups like the Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association (Rehda) and the Master Builders Association Malaysia had warned of cost pressures and disruptions to ongoing projects and businesses.
Under the new tax regime, a 6% service tax will be imposed on construction services for infrastructure, commercial, and industrial buildings, if the taxable value exceeds RM1.5 million annually.
Nga also addressed fears over cascading taxes, saying that a business-to-business (B2B) exemption mechanism ensures the service tax is imposed only once along the value chain.
He said the sales tax for basic construction materials such as cement, aggregates and sand remains at 0%.
Out of 400 tariff codes related to building materials, Nga added that tax hikes apply to only eight, including items like laminated glass and vats, affecting just 2% of materials.
Contractors may also separate material costs from service charges, allowing the SST to be applied solely to construction services.
“The housing and local government ministry remains committed to working with the finance ministry and key stakeholders to ensure fair tax implementation, protect homebuyers’ interests, and support a sustainable housing sector,” Nga said.
“The ministry remains committed to preserving housing affordability and protecting homebuyers’ interests under the revised SST framework.”

PUTRAJAYA, June 15 (Bernama) -- Residential properties sold under the Housing Development Act (HDA) will be exempted from the update Sales and Services Tax (SST), following concerns from the construction industry over rising costs.
  Housing and Local Government Minister Nga Kor Ming said the exemption applies to all residential buildings, including serviced apartments built on commercial land, provided they are intended for residential use and fall under the HDA.
  He said this following discussions with Finance Minister II, Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan after industry players raised concerns about the impact of cascading taxes under the revised SST framework.
  Nga said the issue will be addressed through business-to-business (B2B) exemptions, ensuring that the service tax is only applied at a single stage.
  The Finance Ministry clarified that basic construction materials such as cement, sand and aggregates will continue to be taxed at 0 per cent. Of the 400 tariff codes covering building materials, only eight will see an increase, affecting items such as laminated glass, netting and vats.
  “This will affect only two per cent of the total building material tariff codes,” he said.
  Nga added that contractors may also separate material costs from service charges, allowing the service tax to apply solely to construction services.
  He noted that the government remains committed to balancing fiscal reforms with housing affordability.
  “KPKT will continue engaging with the Finance Ministry and stakeholders to ensure fair implementation of tax policies and protect the interests of homebuyers,” he added.

The Malaysia Express Bus Operators Association (PBEM) supports the Transport Ministry’s proposal to introduce a new driver database and mandate the installation of speed limiters on all heavy vehicles, including express and tour buses.

PBEM chairperson Nazri Yusof said the database would help operators recruit better-qualified drivers by screening applicants based on clean employment and traffic records, while avoiding those with poor discipline or frequent offences.

MANILA: Environmental group EcoWaste Coalition has warned the public about sexual enhancement and energy products in sidewalk stalls, Chinese drug stores and online sellers that pose serious health risks to men, as the country celebrates Father’s Day.
  In a statement on Sunday (June 15), the group pointed out that these products lack authorisation for sale and may contain potent ingredients that could have serious side effects, according to health authorities in the Philippines, as well as the United States and Canada.
  “Many products that claim to help with sexual enhancement or treat sexual dysfunction – such as male enhancement supplements, erectile dysfunction treatments, male energy pills, and stamina pills – are likely to be contaminated with dangerous hidden ingredients. These contaminated products are a type of medication health fraud,” the EcoWaste said, citing the US Food and Drug Administration.
  “These products are sometimes falsely advertised as dietary supplements, food and/or all-natural treatments. They often have multiple positive reviews and/or are being shared through social media. These products pose serious health risks and are not guaranteed to work. They can lead to severe health issues and hospitalisation,” it added.
  EcoWaste said some of the ingredients of the product should only be consumed under the supervision of a healthcare professional, some of the products also contain contents not included in label, “such as prescription drugs sildenafil and/or tadalafil possibly at doses exceeding maximum recommended amounts.”
  Citing the FDA, the group explained that “sildenafil citrate is a prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction in males and is prohibited in food supplements due to potential health risks, particularly for persons who have had a stroke, those with cardiovascular diseases, kidney problems, and low blood pressure.”
  “Possible side effects of consuming sexual enhancement or energy products with sildenafil citrate include changes in vision or sudden vision loss, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, indigestion, nasal congestion, urinary tract infection, and priapism,” it added, quoting the FDA said.
  Similarly, tadalafil is a prescription drug used to treat male sexual problems but poses side effects to individuals who have had a stroke, as well as blood, heart, kidney and stomach ulcer problems.
  In line with this, the group advised the public to avoid buying unregistered products and instead consult a health professional before buying or consuming such products. - Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN

PETALING JAYA: Tidak mahu timbul salah faham, penyanyi baharu, Syed Iqbal, 24, menegaskan bahawa keputusannya membawakan lagu berbahasa Arab menerusi single Basstamam bukanlah kerana ingin meniru abangnya yang juga pendakwah terkenal, Da’i Syed.
  Sebaliknya, menurut pemilik nama penuh Syed Muhammad Iqbal Jamalulleil itu, minatnya terhadap qasidah dan bahasa Arab sudah berputik sejak zaman kanak-kanak lagi.
  “Bukan saya nak ikut atau tiru abang saya. Memang sejak kecil saya sudah terbiasa dengan lagu-lagu Arab dan sering berqasidah.
  “Kami sekeluarga pun menggunakan bahasa Arab sebagai bahasa pertuturan harian,” katanya.
  Menariknya, sebelum bergelar penyanyi, Syed Iqbal terlebih dahulu aktif sebagai penterjemah bahasa Arab bagi beberapa ulama tersohor dari luar negara.
  “Saya banyak terlibat dalam sesi terjemahan untuk tokoh-tokoh agama seperti Habib Zaid Yahya, Habib Idrus Al Aydrus dan Sheikh Mukhtar Jamel.
  “Bahasa Arab sudah sebati dengan diri saya. Malah, bila berjumpa rakan pun saya lebih selesa berbicara dalam bahasa itu,” ujarnya lagi.
  Tambah Syed Iqbal, bahasa Arab bukan sahaja menjadi medium dalam karier seninya, malah turut menjadi bahasa perantara dalam kehidupan seharian bersama keluarga dan rakan-rakan terdekat.
  Dalam perkembangan, lagu Basstamam ciptaan Amir Hufaz dan Wan Salleh, dengan lirik oleh AbdulKarim Al Ali dan Wan Salleh, semakin mendapat perhatian selepas mencatat lebih 300,000 tontonan di YouTube.
  Lagu yang menggabungkan elemen moden dan klasik Arab itu turut mendapat maklum balas positif daripada peminat yang mengakui tertarik dengan kelainan dibawa Syed Iqbal. – UTUSAN

重稀土元素，大马也拥有储存量，只是目前的开采与生产规模仍然有限。而这正好是大马将美国关税危机化为转机的机会。
强国如美国，也有任人捏圆搓扁的致命弱点，那就是稀土。由于美国总统特朗普长期打压中国，中国一气之下从全面禁止到限制对美国的稀土出口，导致包括福特汽车在内的美国汽车工厂因缺乏稀土元素被迫暂停部分生产线，这迫使特朗普不得不与中国国家主席习近平通话讨个说法。虽然两人通话及两国进行贸易谈判后，特朗普表示稀土供应将不再是问题，但他一向的言论，往往只有时间才能证实其真实性。

ADVERTISEMENT

至于重稀土元素，大马也拥有储存量，只是目前的开采与生产规模仍然有限。而这正好是大马将美国关税危机化为转机的机会。
简而言之，稀土元素是17种化学元素的总称，可分为轻稀土与重稀土两类。其中，包括镝（Dy）与铽（Tb）在内的重稀土金属，常被用来制造耐热稀土磁体，这类产品是汽车与电子产品中不可或缺的关键材料。

目前，全球约70%的稀土元素由中国开采，而99.9%的重稀土精炼产能也集中在中国。中国以外唯一一家大规模生产重稀土的企业莱纳斯（Lynas）就在大马。莱纳斯原本主要处理来自澳洲矿山的稀土，过去只生产轻稀土元素，但已于今年5月开始量产镝（Dy），铽（Tb）也预计于本月投产。大马拥有约1600万吨尚未开采的稀土资源，估值达约8000亿令吉。

其实，这并非中国首次将稀土作为国际谈判筹码。2010年，日本海上保安厅在钓鱼台海域扣押一艘中国渔船及船长，中国除了外交抗议外，亦非正式地暂停对日本的稀土出口。虽然未发布正式禁令，但多家日本企业反映供应中断。事后，日本开始向大马采购稀土，实施来源多元化策略，马来西亚亦因此成为日本稀土进口来源之一。
因此，当美国遭遇与日本当年类似的情况，被中国掐住稀土供应咽喉之际，大马谈判代表团在与美国谈判时，应将重稀土供应列为重要谈判筹码，提醒美方必须退让，并建议美国在大马投资设厂，直接开采与生产本地稀土资源。

当年莱纳斯在大马的初期投资约2亿美元，创造约400个就业机会，每年稀土出口额高达数亿美元。若美国前来设厂，不仅可提升大马经济，更可使大马纳入全球关键矿产产业链，进一步推进成为先进国的目标。

尽管美国政府已与莱纳斯签署在德州兴建新精炼厂的合约，金额高达2.58亿美元，但德州经常面临飓风与洪水等天灾，再加上美国人工成本高昂，将提高生产成本。相比之下，大马是美国实现稀土来源多元化的另一个理想选择。
至于稀土开采与生产所带来的环保课题，大马政府必须从源头开始把关，包括加强环境法规、完善放射性副产物的处理方法，以及推动土地生态修复。这方面应结合本地与国际大学及企业的专业力量。
总而言之，大马在与美国的关税谈判中，绝不能错过这一个战略转机。

JAKARTA: President Prabowo Subianto will fly to Russia next week to meet with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and attend several economic events in the European country, snubbing an invitation to attend the Group of Seven (G7) Summit in Canada.
  The President will go to Russia with a limited delegation at Putin’s invitation, according to the Foreign Ministry, where the two leaders will engage in discussions on “the latest global developments and issues of common concerns” to mark the 75th anniversary of Indonesia-Russia relations.
  In a week packed with international economic and political engagements, Prabowo is slated to fly out of Jakarta on Monday (June 16) and to visit Singapore first. He is expected to start his two-day visit in Russia on Wednesday, where he will produce a high-level declaration as well as at least three memorandums of understanding (MoU) following a tête-à-tête with Putin, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Rolliansyah Soemirat said.
  Prabowo will also attend the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg during his visit. The trip will mark Prabowo’s first official visit to Singapore and Russia since taking office last October.
  As his agenda in Russia kicks off on Wednesday, the President will not be attending the G7 Summit in Canada slated for Tuesday, to which he was invited by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney earlier this week
  Rolliansyah did not disclose which invitation had arrived first when asked by reporters. But he reassured that Prabowo had been planning to visit Russia since last 2024, and had already made a promise to visit Singapore prior to Carney’s G7 invite. Not attending the G7 meeting, Rolliansyah underlined, is a consequence of the President “staying true to himself in fulfilling prior commitments”.
  “We cannot see the President and the foreign minister’s activities only through the lens of attendances or representations, but also in how these activities can benefit a larger national interest,” the ministry spokesperson said.
  The agreements to be signed with Russia will touch on cooperation on transportation, higher education and creative economy, although negotiations on other matters are still taking place.
  Prabowo previously met with Putin in Moscow in July last year during his European tour a few months after being declared president-elect by the country’s poll body.
  At that time, Prabowo reaffirmed Russia’s historical significance for Indonesia and pledged to strengthen the two countries’ relationship once in office.
  During the July 2024 meeting, Putin also emphasised that Indonesia is of interest to Russia, given its large population. The Russian president also promised to increase Moscow’s agricultural exports and to bring energy, transportation and infrastructure projects to Indonesia.
  Responding to Prabowo’s Russian visit in July 2024, experts said the move was a signal against Western-oriented global leadership. The perception of Prabowo possibly having reservations against Western leadership further gained traction when he entered Indonesia into BRICS, the economic coalition founded by Russia and China with a strong counter-West reputation, less than six months after meeting Putin in Moscow.
  Indonesia is not a member of the West-leaning G7 grouping, but has attended several of its summits as a guest when former president Joko “Jokowi” Widodo was in office.
  During the Jokowi administration, Indonesia attempted to maintain a balance in its relationship among competing global powers, including when it dismissed calls not to invite Russia to the Group of Twenty (G20) Summit in Bali in 2022.
  As president, Prabowo has on various occasions emphasised his refusal to be led by any foreign power, frequently underlining the need for a fairer international system and a national interest-first approach to foreign policy.
  The focus on Indonesia’s national interests is also expected to be at the forefront of Prabowo’s visit to Singapore. His discussion with Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, according to the Foreign Ministry, will revolve around future strategic engagements focusing on the economy.
  “Strategic cooperation will be discussed,” Rolliansyah said, “and it will be done in the format of a retreat, in which leaders are typically more open to express their views and give their insights.”
  Singapore has been Indonesia’s largest source of foreign direct investment in the last decade. A total of US$20.1 billion was funnelled into the country last year, and US$4.6 billion was invested during the first quarter of 2025.
  Monday’s meeting will mark the first official meeting between the leaders. But Prabowo has met Wong several times, including during the latter’s state visit to Jakarta in November for an “introductory” meeting.
  During the November meeting, both leaders reaffirmed the strong friendship between Indonesia and Singapore. Prabowo emphasised five priority areas for bilateral cooperation, including defence, food security and human capital development. - The Jakarta Post/ANN

BAODING, CHINA –
Media OutReach Newswire
– 15 June 2025 – While new energy vehicles continue to gain momentum worldwide, efficient diesel power remains a compelling choice—especially in challenging off-road environments where torque, range, and reliability are critical. GWM is advancing diesel technology with a focus on refinement, performance, and real-world usability. At the recent GWM Thailand Diesel Day event, the brand demonstrated how modern diesel can deliver a clean, quiet, and highly capable driving experience.
Traditional trade-offs—torque versus comfort, power versus fuel economy—are disappearing. With today’s drivers demanding both performance and efficiency, GWM’s TANK 300 Diesel delivers on all fronts.
In Thailand, the TANK 300 Diesel has earned high praise for its impressive torque (480N·m at just 1,500rpm), extended driving range (up to 1,200km), and smooth, quiet ride. As one reviewer noted, “It drives like a gasoline SUV—quiet and refined—until you need the torque. Then, it just powers through.”
This refined balance comes from GWM’s 2.4T diesel engine, combined with over 200 NVH (Noise, Vibration, and Harshness) enhancements—bringing idle noise down to just 65dB, comparable to gasoline-powered vehicles. The result: urban comfort with true off-road muscle.
GWM’s advanced combustion technology—featuring columnar combustion chambers and dual tangential air ducts—cuts fuel consumption to under 7.3L/100km, making long journeys more economical and environmentally responsible.
Guided by its “All Scenarios, All Powertrains, All Users” strategy, GWM’s TANK 300 Diesel demonstrates that diesel, when done right, is still a powerful, relevant solution to real-world needs. In markets like Thailand, clean diesel has a promising future.
More than just a product launch, GWM’s achievement reflects a user-centered innovation that sets a new benchmark. The message to drivers is clear: more power, fewer compromises, and a brand that truly listens.

(Reuters) -Coach Stephen Larkham did not believe his ACT Brumbies side went into Saturday's Super Rugby Pacific clash with the Waikato Chiefs in a negative frame of mind despite the team's dismal semi-final track record.
  The Brumbies crashed out in the semi-finals for the fourth season in a row as Larkham's side lost 37-17 to the Chiefs, who set up an all-New Zealand final against the Canterbury Crusaders in Christchurch next week.
  "Psychologically, I thought we were in a good place, I thought our preparation was really good to build into this game from the other games that we've played," said Larkham. 
  "I don't know if that was a factor. We certainly have spoken a lot to make sure that that doesn't come into it. 
  "It's hard to play away from home, whether it's in Australia or New Zealand. There is an advantage to the home side and I thought they played really well."
  Larkham has been at the helm for three of the Brumbies' four semi-final losses, having also overseen a defeat at the hands of the Chiefs in 2023 ahead of last year's reversal against the Auckland Blues.
  Those defeats prompted the former Wallaby to launch reviews into his team's operations and Larkham vowed to go through a similar process when the current season concludes after his side's clash with the British and Irish Lions next month.
  "We'll go through the process of identifying, particularly in these last two games, what wasn't robust, what isn't good enough yet and spend enough time in the off-season to put us in a better position," he said.
  "The British and Irish Lions game for us is around the corner. We'll have a short prep going into that. We'll run the same program that we've been running into this game, we'll just see if we can do it better."

Zurkarnain Mohd Yasin menegaskan tuduhan tidak berasas berhubung inisiatif data telefon bimbit (MPD) boleh mengelirukan orang ramai.
PETALING JAYA
:
Suruhanjaya Komunikasi dan Multimedia Malaysia (SKMM) menegaskan inisiatif data telefon bimbit (MPD) bukan untuk memantau atau pengawasan individu seperti didakwa segelintir pihak.
Timbalan Pengarah Urusannya Zurkarnain Mohd Yasin menjelaskan langkah itu berasaskan data raya (big data) digunakan secara agregat untuk menghasilkan pandangan makro bagi membantu perancangan pembangunan negara.
Menurutnya, projek itu masih di peringkat awal dan Jabatan Perangkaan (DOSM) akan mengadakan sesi libat urus bersama pihak berkepentingan untuk penerangan lanjut selepas ini.
Zurkarnain menekankan inisiatif itu diiktiraf secara rasmi Pertubuhan Bangsa-Bangsa Bersatu (PBB) sebagai sumber data raya utama bagi memperkukuh statistik dan alat berkuasa meningkatkan kualiti, ketepatan masa serta perincian maklumat.
“PBB telah menubuhkan Pasukan Petugas Khas Data Telefon Bimbit di bawah Jawatankuasa Pakar Data Raya dan Sains Data melibatkan lebih 50 ahli termasuk Malaysia daripada agensi antarabangsa, kerajaan, akademia dan sektor swasta.
“Inisiatif global ini menyerlahkan keperluan mendesak melangkaui kaedah statistik tradisional dan menerima pakai penyelesaian data yang inovatif bagi memahami serta menangani cabaran masyarakat dengan lebih berkesan,” katanya dalam kenyataan kepada FMT.
Selain Malaysia, Pasukan Petugas Khas Data Telefon Bimbit PBB turut dianggotai antaranya Jepun, Brazil, Itali, Mexico, Arab Saudi dan Indonesia.
Baru-baru ini, Presiden MCA Wee Ka Siong mendakwa tindakan kerajaan mengarahkan semua syarikat telekomunikasi menyerahkan data penuh pengguna telefon, antara lain mengganggu privasi serta membuka ruang salah guna maklumat.
Ada juga segelintir pihak cuba menggambarkan kerajaan sedang melakukan ‘pengintipan besar-besaran’ ke atas rakyat menerusi MPD.
Zurkarnain menegaskan tuduhan tidak berasas tanpa usul periksa berhubung MPD boleh mengelirukan orang ramai selain berpotensi menjejaskan usaha negara membangunkan sumber data rasmi yang lebih tepat dan boleh dipercayai.
“Data rasmi lebih tepat membolehkan pengukuhan perancangan dasar awam dan mempertingkatkan penyampaian perkhidmatan,” katanya.
Beliau turut menafikan data dikumpulkan mengandungi maklumat peribadi pengguna sebaliknya dalam bentuk agregat dan telah dinyah identiti sepenuhnya.
“Ia tidak mengandungi sebarang maklumat peribadi atau yang boleh mengenal pasti individu,” katanya sambil menjelaskan tiada mekanisme pilihan masuk atau keluar terlibat kerana data digunakan sebahagian daripada operasi asas rangkaian mudah alih.
Katanya, pada peringkat awal data dijana secara automatik apabila peranti mudah alih berinteraksi dengan menara pemancar itu diproses serta dinyah identiti di syarikat telekomunikasi.
“Hanya selepas itu, data agregat telah dinyah identiti dikemukakan kepada DOSM dan SKMM.
“Tiada sebarang pemindahan data mentah atau maklumat pengguna dilakukan di luar premis MNO,” katanya.

MCMC’s Zurkarnain Yasin said unfounded claims about the mobile phone data initiative risks confusing the public and undermining trust in national data systems.
PETALING JAYA
:
The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) has clarified that the mobile phone data initiative is not intended to track or monitor individuals, as alleged by some quarters.
Its deputy managing director, Zurkarnain Yasin, said the data is fully anonymised and only used in aggregate to help provide macro-level insights for national development planning.
He said the project, still in its early stages, has received formal recognition from the United Nations as a key big data source to improve the quality, accuracy and timeliness of official statistics.
“This global initiative reflects the urgent need to go beyond traditional statistical methods and adopt innovative data solutions to better understand and address societal challenges,” he said in a statement to FMT.
The UN has also set up a special task force involving over 50 countries and organisations, including Malaysia, to explore the use of mobile data for development.
Other members include Japan, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.
Zurkarnain said the statistics department, which leads the project, will hold briefings with stakeholders soon.
His comments came in response to concerns raised by MCA president Wee Ka Siong, who questioned whether the government’s directive for telecommunication companies to share user data could violate privacy and lead to potential abuse.
Some parties have gone further, accusing the government of engaging in large-scale “spying” on citizens through the mobile phone data project.
Zurkarnain dismissed these claims as baseless, saying such narratives could mislead the public and undermine efforts to develop more reliable sources of national data.
“More precise official data allows for stronger public policy planning and better service delivery,” he said.
He also clarified that the data collected does not include any personal or identifiable information, with no mechanism for opting in or out, as the data is drawn from standard mobile network operations.
At the technical level, Zurkarnain said the data is automatically generated when a mobile device interacts with transmission towers.
He said this data is then processed and anonymised at the telco level before being submitted to the statistics department and MCMC.
“There is no transfer of raw data or user information outside the premises of mobile network operators,” he added.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 (Bernama) -- The Department of Labour Peninsular Malaysia (JTKSM) remains committed to safeguarding the welfare and interests of workers in the country, said its director-general Kamal Pardi.
  He said as an agency under the Ministry of Human Resources (KESUMA), JTKSM was responsible for enforcing various labour laws to protect the interests of both workers and employers.
  He said that JTKSM was tasked with protecting the rights and interests of workers, including matters related to wages, leave, housing, and the provision of a safe and conducive working environment.
  “This is to ensure that the welfare, performance and skills of workers continue to be prioritised to boost productivity and work quality, thereby contributing to the country’s economic growth,” he said when featured on Bernama TV’s Apa Khabar Malaysia programme recently.
  Among the laws enforced by JTKSM are the Employment Act 1955, the Workers’ Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act, and the Minimum Wage Order.
  Kamal said JTKSM also regulated the employment of children and young persons to safeguard their welfare and future.
  He explained that children involved in the entertainment and modelling industries, for example, were required to obtain a licence and permission from JTKSM to ensure their welfare and studies were not affected.
  Kamal added that JTKSM regularly carried out enforcement operations and inspections, including at workplaces and accommodation facilities provided by employers, to ensure compliance with the law.
  “This is important to safeguard workers’ welfare and health, thereby increasing productivity and work quality when they are able to work and rest adequately,” he said.
  He urged workers to report any mistreatment or violations of their rights to JTKSM through proper channels or email, assuring that the identity of the complainant would be kept confidential.
  “JTKSM will investigate and take action against employers who violate the law to ensure justice for workers,” he said.

PHNOM PENH: In an age of rapid technological advancements, one Cambodian youth is taking bold steps to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and the Kingdom’s rich culture.
  Rath Chan Ponleu, a digital content creator, has emerged as a driving force behind the integration of AI into Cambodian culture and education.
  His videos created by AI are a reflection of his passion for preserving the rich customs, traditions and language of Cambodia, while exploring the potential of modern technology.
  Ponleu, who posts to the “Ty Ronex” Facebook page, shares short clips of his content, as well as tips and tricks for others to try.
  In one of his captivating AI-generated videos, the protagonist, a Cambodian woman, navigates a mysterious house.
  With traditional Cambodian beauty and charm, she confronts a series of strange occurrences. A conversation with a man she meets inside the house only adds to the suspense, as she seeks to uncover the truth behind the house’s enigmatic nature.
  The core message of the video, though set against a backdrop of mystery, highlights the importance of Cambodian identity.
  The young creator’s purpose is clear — to train AI to understand and represent Cambodian culture, language and traditions.
  By using AI technology, he hopes to bring Cambodian heritage to a global audience, showcasing the beauty of the Khmer language and the stories that have shaped Cambodia for centuries.
  In his efforts to train AI systems to understand and promote the Kingdom’s unique culture, Ponleu is not only exploring the future of AI but also shaping how the next generation of Cambodians can engage with this transformative technology.
  His journey into AI began with a deep curiosity about how this powerful tool could be harnessed to advance understanding and preserve cultural identity.
  “I want to know how good AI is and what it will be like in the future. The more data we train it with, the better it gets. Right now, my most popular video features Google's Veo 3 technology," he explained.
  Through his creative videos and educational content, Ponleu is helping others understand how to utilise AI technology in practical and impactful ways.
  AI's power, according to Ponleu, lies in the careful crafting of prompts.
  "AI requires a strong understanding of English sentence structure and the key elements of prompts — subject, object and key words,” he said.
  “The better we understand how to design prompts, the more professional the results will be. For example, if we use basic words, the AI's output will be simpler. But when we structure the prompts carefully, like including specific lighting details, the results can be truly professional,” he added.
  One of the biggest challenges Ponleu faces is overcoming AI’s difficulty in recognising Cambodian culture and its distinct characteristics.
  He noted that AI systems often confuse Cambodian cultural elements with those of neighboring countries such as Thailand, Vietnam or Laos.
  “The AI still has a hard time distinguishing the faces, clothing, and traditions of Cambodia from other South-East Asian nations,” he told The Post.
  His advice to fellow Cambodians is to include specific details in AI prompts, such as references to Cambodian culture, clothing and ethnicity, to help the system improve its recognition of the unique Cambodian identity.
  Ponleu’s insight into AI's cultural understanding is particularly crucial when it comes to creating accurate representations of Cambodia's ancient and modern heritage.
  “For instance, when I asked AI to generate a video of ‘ancient women in traditional clothing near Angkor Wat’, the results were not what I had hoped for,” he said.
  "The AI often confused the traditional Cambodian style with that of neighbouring countries." However, with further adjustments — adding details like skin tone and specific clothing styles from the appropriate era — Ponleu has been able to improve the results.
  The challenge of getting AI to recognise facial features and profiles also persists, but through techniques like locking a “seed” to maintain consistency, he is able to manipulate the video content for more accurate depictions.
  Ponleu remains optimistic about AI's potential to revolutionise the way Cambodians create and consume content.
  AI’s versatility can simplify many tasks, he explained, especially for those who are camera-shy or lack professional skills.
  “For example, employees who are afraid of being on camera can still create videos by using AI to generate actions based on their facial features and body shape,” he noted.
  This technology also has the potential to save time and costs by eliminating the need for travel and on-location shooting.
  However, Ponleu acknowledges that AI’s understanding of current events and locations is still limited.
  “AI often uses outdated images, like older pictures of Angkor Wat, instead of capturing the latest scenes,” he said.
  He believes that the full potential of AI will be realised when companies collaborate with the Cambodian government and local organisations to ensure the technology reflects real-time developments and accurately captures Cambodia's rich heritage. - The Phnom Penh Post/ANN

尤其是在夜晚行驶时，没有路灯的照明下，潜伏极大的危机，要是遇上雨天，更是提心吊胆。
尽管说，一些车祸的肇因是车子超速行驶，无关路灯和四周环境黑暗，可是，有了路灯的照明，将能大大降低车祸的风险。
加叻大道
有多个路段被列为车祸黑区，尤其是靠近武吉丁宜上下斜坡的路段，经常发生死亡车祸，文冬警区主任也曾经要求当局装置路灯，可是都没有下文。
从丹斯里廖中莱担任文冬区国会议员，之后到黄德中选成为文冬区国议员，再到今天的雪芙菈，换了3名国会议员，都无法为加叻大道车祸黑区争取到一盏路灯照明，让人深感失望。
所以，当看到陆兆福说可能在东西大道宜力—日里路段安装385盏太阳能灯，文冬人民都忍不住说：YB，加叻大道也很需要太阳能灯。
目前所见，当局在加叻大道进行了安全措施的工程，可是如果能够在几个车祸黑区装置太阳灯，相信一定能有助减低车祸的发生，公路使用者也会非常感激。

台中市北屯区北京里长苏乙青发现青年流落街头，将他带回里长办公处清理。 （图／ETtoday新闻云·里长苏乙青提供）
（台北15日讯）台湾台中1名21岁青年流落街头，在回收厂捡回收物，当地里长一问下发现青年不太识字、举止宛如10岁孩童，结果发现他不但没有户口也没上过学，长年来还被要求不得走出套房，形同软禁，近日因故被赶出家门。社会局表示，将积极协助男子取得户籍、就业、居住等相关事宜，帮助他稳定生活。
据ETtoday新闻云报道，据当地里长苏乙青转述，青年自述姓黄，经联系黄的父亲，黄父称愿意赶快来帮他办户口，但他6月8日前往同一个回收厂时，又再次遇到青年，且身上发出臭味，他就将青年带回里长办公处，让他饱餐一顿，并给予衣物及盥洗。

苏说，相处过程发现青年的举止如同10岁孩童，不会怕生，很愿意跟别人说话，不过几乎不识字，对于许多事情的理解就像是小孩子。据青年说，由于没有户口，长期被父亲要求待在套房里，不准出门，父亲还吓青年「如果出门就会被警察抓走」，青年因此乖乖听话。
苏指出，青年父亲疑以打零工维生，收入不稳定，目前他已联系不上对方；据青年说，今年2月他从套房阳台摔落，跌破1楼阳台遮雨棚，赔了9000元（1293令吉），父亲大怒将他赶出家门，只好以捡回收变卖果腹，流落街头。
苏表示，青年很有礼貌、也很孝顺，青年对他说，「我很爱爸爸，希望赶快去工作赚钱养爸爸」，他问青年爸爸这样对你，你还觉得是好爸爸吗？青年回应「爸爸赚钱很辛苦，养我长大，所以是好爸爸」。苏说，也许父亲的做法不能说是软禁，只是做法比较不恰当。
台中市政府社会局表示，有关21岁男子无户籍一案，男子因露宿街头被通报，社会局立即前往协助安置男子，提供餐食和住所庇护，并持续关怀及联系家属。男子自述没有户籍证件，从小被爸爸要求待在租屋处不得外出，也没有受过教育，但因男子表达有限，许多资讯仍需进一步查证厘清。
社会局强调，将与相关局处积极协助男子取得户籍、就业、居住等相关事宜，帮助他稳定生活。

KUCHING, June 15 (Bernama) -- The Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development (KPWKM) is taking a more aggressive stance in tackling youth mental health issues by rolling out a series of early intervention initiatives, including mobile counselling services and local community support centres.
  Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri said the ministry is deeply concerned about the rising incidence of mental health struggles among young people and is committed to providing accessible support through programmes that involve collaboration with parents, schools and community organisations.
  "One of our key efforts is deploying counselling buses to targeted areas, making it easier for youths to access psychological support. Many are unaware that they are struggling until they are given an outlet, for example, through art therapy like drawing, which can reveal suppressed emotional distress," she said.
  Speaking at a press conference after officiating the Kem Kapten Keluarga (Family Captain Camp) in Santubong here today, Nancy stressed that recent tragedies involving adolescents underscore the urgent need for early intervention.
  She cited a recent case in Melaka where a Form Five student allegedly killed his mother and elder brother.
  In addition to supporting youth, the ministry is promoting healthier family dynamics through initiatives such as ‘second honeymoon’ programmes for married couples and parenting awareness sessions for new parents, she said.
  The family camp, held in conjunction with the National Father's Day celebration, was organised by the National Population and Family Development Board (LPPKN) and attended by LPPKN chairperson Datuk Seri Rohani Abdul Karim.
  Nancy also urged the public to overcome stigma around mental health and to speak up or seek help when in need.
  “In Sarawak, for example, there are many forms of support available for students and communities. What matters most is to talk, whether it is with a friend, a relative or someone you trust,” she said.
  In her speech at the event, Nancy highlighted the growing demands placed on fathers in today’s fast-paced society, where emotional, intellectual and social involvement is expected alongside traditional roles.
  Quoting findings from the 2024 Father's Day Public Opinion Survey, she noted that nine out of ten fathers admitted that parenting today is far more challenging than in previous generations.
  “The top concerns among fathers are the high cost of living at 84.4 per cent, and the struggle to maintain work-life balance, 72.9 per cent,” she added.

VIENTIANE: The fifth “Lane Xang” electric multiple unit train arrived in Laos on June 13 to cater to the growing demand for passenger services on the Laos-China Railway.
  As of May 30, 2025, the railway had transported 1,660,000 passengers, a nine per cent increase compared to the same period last year, according to the Laos-China Railway Co Ltd.
  The fifth “Lane Xang” train arrives in Laos on June 13 to support rising passenger numbers on the Laos-China Railway.
  The new train is part of the CR200J series and will increase the railway’s capacity, especially during major festivals and the tourist season.
  The Laos-China Railway Company said the additional train will boost operating efficiency and service quality. It is expected to ease the demand for tickets and allow passengers to plan trips further in advance. Tickets can currently be booked only four days ahead of the date of travel.
  The fifth Lane Xang train also marks another step forward in Laos’s goal to modernise its transport infrastructure and strengthen cross-border links with neighbouring countries.
  Designed to suit the Lao climate and terrain, the train includes business class, first class and second class seating, as well as facilities for passengers with disabilities. It can carry up to 632 passengers.
  The Minister of Public Works and Transport, Mr Ngampasong Muangmany, said the new train will improve travel options and support Laos’s development as a regional hub for transport and trade.
  The train’s red, blue and white exterior reflects the colours of the Lao national flag, in line with the design of earlier Lane Xang trains.
  The Laos-China Railway has become a key route for international transport, enhancing connectivity within Laos and the region while supporting tourism, trade and investment.
  The railway began operations in December 2021. By June 2025, the line had carried a total of 9.65 million passengers,
  Over more than two years of cross-border operations, the railway has carried 530,000 cross-border travellers, making travel between Laos, China and other nations more accessible.
  The freight service has transported more than 13.91 million tonnes of goods, linking Laos with China and other countries in the region. - Vientiane Times/ANN

希盟青年团团长吴家良批评，伊青团将反对《都市更新法案》集会仓促改为“倒安华集会”，根本师出无名和毫无正当性，是典型“为反而反”的虚伪行径。
  “伊青团原本宣称要集会反对《都市更新法》，但相关法案尚未提呈，更遑论辩论与表决。”
  “他们提出的反对理由也从未站得住脚，如今仓促改为‘倒安华集会’，分明是为了遮掩自己政策立场的苍白无力。”
  吴家良也是社青团全国总团长。他今天发文告指出，伊党发动这场集会只是为了掩饰自己缺乏建设性的论述，避免在集会当天让支持者发现他们根本不知道到底是为了什么而上街。

 By Ian Jeremiah Patrick 
 Sunday, 15 Jun 2025 7:00 AM MYT 


KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 — When you talk about Malaysia’s indie culture, it’s clear how much it has grown over the years — fuelled by passionate youth expressing themselves through music, art, and, yes, publishing.
You may have come across many indie publishing houses across the country, but here’s one that goes beyond just books — meet Rabak-Lit, the boundary-pushing force reshaping the scene.

Founded by Mohd Jayzuan — a well-known author, poet, and musician — Rabak-Lit began as a part-time publishing venture in Ipoh around 2012.
“The purpose of starting up Rabak-Lit was so we can dedicate ourselves to the arts and not have to work full-time at other jobs,” said Jayzuan to Malay Mail recently.

The project initially focused on publishing work by a close-knit network of friends in Ipoh.

It only transitioned into a full-fledged publishing house in 2019, when it was taken over by Izzat Amir, an active industry player with over 10 years of experience in publishing, having started his career with PTS Publications and Puteh Press.
Now based in Seremban, Rabak-Lit stands out for its unwavering commitment to freedom of expression and the independent spirit that defines each of its book releases.


Among its standout titles are Rebel Playlist by Nasir Jani and Gonzo Tanpa Fiasco by Ku Syafiq, both of which received positive reviews nationwide.

From books to sneakers: Reviving Fung Keong
Not content with being just a publishing house, Rabak-Lit has branched into other creative ventures — organising mini concerts, hosting gigs, and producing T-shirts and shoes.
“Rabak-Lit is now, I’d say, more like a cultured campaign company,” said Izzat.
“We’ve grown into more than just a publishing house.”
Arguably its most talked-about venture is the revival of the iconic Fung Keong sneakers — once a staple in the 1980s and 1990s — through a partnership with the original rubber shoe brand.
“The main purpose of the collaboration was to bring the legendary Fung Keong shoes (FK sneakers) back to the Malaysian market after being discontinued in 1990.
The sneakers now are under Rabak-Lit’s rights through a collaboration agreement with Fung Keong, which also allows us to use the FK name,” he added.
Negotiations began in 2022, and by 2023, the first revival sneaker — the “FK Action Nasir Jani” — was launched in collaboration with the actor-director himself.
Since then, FK sneakers have featured collaborations with other Malaysian icons.

At the Kuala Lumpur International Book Fair (KLIBF) 2025, the “FK Kembara Seniman Jalanan M. Nasir” edition drew buzz — a tribute to the 1986 cult film starring Datuk M. Nasir. Nearly 70 per cent of that release has already sold out.
A limited-edition pair inspired by the character “Osman Tikus” — played by the late Pyan Habib — was also released and quickly became a collector’s item.
Another hit: the “FK Keluang Man” sneakers, launched alongside the film’s gala premiere. These too received glowing reviews and have seen over 200 pre-orders since May.
Rabak-Lit has also teamed up with actor Adam John and Kelantanese punk band NO GOOD for sneaker editions inspired by their distinctive styles.
Coming soon: the FK SIAR Sneakers, in collaboration with local OTT platform SIAR, which celebrates Malaysian cinema across eras and genres.
“The new sneakers will be launched as part of the ‘50 Tahun Filem Malaysia’ campaign, a special event set to take place at the end of the year, which celebrates Malaysian films.”

What’s next for Rabak-Lit
The company shows no signs of slowing down.
Beyond sneakers, Izzat shared that Rabak-Lit will be managing merchandise for the Tamasya Anak Muda concert at the end of June and participating in Malaysia’s Art of Speed event in late July.
There are also author tours planned, with upcoming stops in Johor, Ipoh, and Pahang.
If you’ve made it this far, it’s clear that this is no ordinary publishing house — Rabak-Lit is a living testament to Malaysia’s indie spirit, and its momentum is only building.
When asked about store expansion, Izzat explained that Rabak-Lit already distributes its books and products nationwide — from SMO Bookstore in Kelantan and Terengganu, to Gerakbudaya in Petaling Jaya, and Badan Cemerlang in Johor.
“Our distribution already covers the whole of Malaysia,” he added.
With concert merchandise in the works, author tours on the road, and new sneaker drops — including the FK SIAR edition linked to a national film campaign — Rabak-Lit is charging ahead, proving that its indie mission is just getting started.

 Sunday, 15 Jun 2025 7:00 AM MYT 


LONDON, June 15 — At her London studio, Merve Bayindir carefully glues on dried flowers onto a pale pink saucer hat. Nearby, an array of other colourful headpieces are on display.
The Turkish-born milliner has been busy making hats for guests attending the annual Royal Ascot racing event, where headwear is a must.

“It is the biggest runway. It’s the Oscars. It’s the Golden Globes...that is what it is for us...milliners, because you can’t see that many amazing hats in one spot at the same time for a week,” she told Reuters.
The horse-racing event, held in Ascot just outside London, kicks off on June 17 for five days. It has become as much known for the colourful fashion as for the sport.

Its various enclosures have different dress codes — the strictest is for the royal enclosure.

“You have to have minimum ten centimetres of diameter on a hat,” Bayindir said.
“So (for) the ladies in royal enclosure, we always say make sure that your hat is not a fascinator,” she added, referring to elaborate, decorative headpieces, often fixed on a band or clip.


For the Queen Anne and village enclosures, hats, headpieces or fascinators are allowed.
In terms of colours, Bayindir said designs in pale pink and blue were annual staples, with fuchsia, sage green and lilac also proving popular lately. As for size, the bigger the better.

“It doesn’t matter who you are, you can be the star and take that chance and be outrageous,” she said.
“Royal Ascot itself has a very big personality. So you need to sort of support that big personality and be part of it if you want to be really enjoying the environment.” — Reuters

ISLAMABAD, June 15 — Since seeing thousands of comments justifying the recent murder of a teenage TikTok star in Pakistan, Sunaina Bukhari is considering abandoning her 88,000 followers.  
  “In my family, it wasn’t an accepted profession at all, but I’d managed to convince them, and even ended up setting up my own business,” she said. 
  Then last week, Sana Yousaf was shot dead outside her house in the capital Islamabad by a man whose advances she had repeatedly rejected, police said. 
  News of the murder led to an outpouring of comments under her final post — her 17th birthday celebration where she blew out the candles on a cake.
  In between condolence messages, some blamed her for her own death: “You reap what you sow” or “it’s deserved, she was tarnishing Islam”. 
  Yousaf had racked up more than a million followers on social media, where she shared her favourite cafes, skincare products and traditional shalwar kameez outfits. 
  TikTok is wildly popular in Pakistan, in part because of its accessibility to a population with low literacy levels. On it, women have found both audience and income, rare in a country where fewer than a quarter of the women participate in the formal economy. 
  But as TikTok’s views have surged, so have efforts to police the platform.
  Pakistani telecommunications authorities have repeatedly blocked or threatened to block the app over what it calls “immoral behaviour”, amid backlash against LGBTQ and sexual content.
  TikTok has pledged to better moderate content and blocked millions of videos that do not meet its community guidelines as well as at the request of Pakistan authorities.
  After Yousaf’s murder, Bukhari, 28, said her family no longer backs her involvement in the industry.
  “I’m the first influencer in my family, and maybe the last,” she told AFP. 
  Demonstrators hold placards and a poster of TikTok star Sana Yousaf during a protest held to condemn violence against women after she was killed for rejecting a man’s proposal in Islamabad June 5, 2025. — AFP pic
  ‘Fear of being judged’  
  Only 30 per cent of women in Pakistan own a smartphone compared to twice as many men (58 per cent), the largest gap in the world, according to the Mobile Gender Gap Report of 2025. 
  “Friends and family often discourage them from using social media for fear of being judged,” said a statement from the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF).
  In southwestern Balochistan, where tribal law governs many rural areas, a man confessed to orchestrating the murder of his 14-year-old daughter earlier this year over TikTok videos that he said compromised her honour.
  In October, police in Karachi, in the south, announced the arrest of a man who had killed four women relatives over “indecent” TikTok videos. 
  These murders each revive memories of Qandeel Baloch, dubbed Pakistan’s Kim Kardashian and one of the country’s first breakout social media stars whose videos shot her to fame. 
  After years in the spotlight, she was suffocated by her brother. 
  Violence against women is pervasive in Pakistan, according to the country’s Human Rights Commission, and cases of women being attacked after rejecting men are not uncommon.
  “This isn’t one crazy man, this is a culture,” said Kanwal Ahmed, who leads a closed Facebook group of 300,000 women to share advice. 
  “Every woman in Pakistan knows this fear. Whether she’s on TikTok or has a private Instagram with 50 followers, men show up. In her DMs. In her comments. On her street,” she wrote in a post.  
  In the fifth-most-populous country in the world, where 60 per cent of the population is under the age of 30, the director of digital rights organisation Bolo Bhi, Usama Khilji, says “many women don’t post their profile picture, but a flower, an object, very rarely their face”.
  “The misogyny and the patriarchy that is prevalent in this society is reflected on the online spaces,” he added. 
  A 22-year-old man was arrested over Yousaf’s murder and is due to appear in court next week. 
  At a vigil in the capital last week, around 80 men and women gathered, holding placards that read “no means no”. 
  “Social media has given us a voice, but the opposing voices are louder,” said Hira, a young woman who joined the gathering. 
  The capital’s police chief, Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, used a press conference to send a “clear message” to the public. 
  “If our sisters or daughters want to become influencers, professionally or as amateurs, we must encourage them,” he said. — AFP

JUNE 15 — Malaysia is currently experiencing prolonged periods of extreme heat, and while much of the public concern has focused on heatstroke and energy consumption, another pressing issue is unfolding quietly: an increase in mosquito activity, particularly the Aedes species responsible for dengue transmission. 
  These rising temperatures are not just a discomfort—they are accelerating the life cycles and disease-spreading potential of mosquitoes in ways we can no longer afford to ignore. 
  As a tropical country, Malaysia has always been hospitable to mosquito populations. However, heatwaves significantly worsen the situation. 
  Elevated temperatures shorten the time it takes for mosquito eggs to hatch, allowing larvae to mature into adults at a faster rate. 
  With more mosquitoes emerging in less time, local populations can surge dramatically. The heat also extends the lifespan of adult mosquitoes, offering a longer window for them to bite and spread viruses such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. 
  More worryingly, studies have shown that warmer conditions enhance the rate at which viruses replicate within the mosquito’s body. 
  This means mosquitoes become infectious earlier in their life, thereby amplifying the potential for outbreaks. 
  In addition to enhancing vector biology, the heatwave is also influencing human behaviour in ways that may inadvertently aid mosquito survival.
  People are more likely to stay indoors, but often forget to eliminate small collections of stagnant water around the home, such as in flowerpots, dish trays, or clogged drains. 
  These become ideal breeding sites, particularly when left unattended for several days. At the same time, fewer people may tolerate fogging activities or opt to wear protective clothing in the heat, thereby reducing the effectiveness of standard preventive measures. 
  Heatwaves means shorter breeding, hatching, and maturing times for mosquitoes that also extend their lifespans, enabling a longer window for them to bite and spread viruses such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. — Unsplash pic
  The data is already showing signs of escalation. As of mid-June this year, over 27,000 dengue cases have been reported nationwide. 
  This represents not just a seasonal spike, but a larger trend that correlates closely with rising ambient temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns. 
  In 2023, Malaysia saw a worrying increase in both dengue infections and hospitalisations, and if current conditions persist, 2024 may prove to be worse. 
  These trends underscore the complex relationship between climate change and infectious disease dynamics—a relationship that is no longer theoretical, but observable in real time. 
  From a public health perspective, this calls for a dual response: one that addresses mosquito control directly, and another that strengthens public awareness of the environmental drivers of disease. 
  Vector control must remain consistent and science-based, with improvements to drainage systems, enhanced surveillance of high-risk areas, and continuous engagement with communities to reduce breeding grounds. 
  Public understanding, meanwhile, must shift from viewing mosquitoes as an isolated nuisance to recognising them as indicators of wider ecological imbalance. 
  There are also individual actions that can help mitigate the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Households should regularly inspect their surroundings for stagnant water, especially after rainfall or routine water use. 
  Applying mosquito repellents, wearing long- sleeved clothing, and installing netted barriers on windows can all reduce exposure, particularly in areas with high case numbers. 
  While these measures may seem basic, they remain essential tools in our efforts to control the spread of dengue. 
  Climate change may feel like a distant global issue, but its consequences are already here—in the form of record-breaking heat, longer mosquito seasons, and rising infection rates. 
  Dengue is not merely a seasonal concern; it is a climate-linked health crisis that demands immediate attention. 
  Though we cannot control the weather, we can control our readiness to respond. 
  By staying vigilant and informed, both individually and collectively, we can limit the impact of this growing threat before it overwhelms our healthcare systems and communities.

  KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 — The upcoming ‘Empat Live in Kuala Lumpur 2025’ concert will unite siblings Ziana Zain and Anuar Zain, along with their niece Ernie Zakri and nephew-in-law Syamel, on one stage for the very first time.
  Speaking about the concert, which will take place at Mega Star Arena in Bukit Bintang here on Oct 18, Anuar said it is a tribute to their family’s artistic journey, while also establishing themselves as a brand in the local music industry.
  “’Empat’ (four) isn’t just a number. It’s a collaboration among four artistes from the same family. We hope it will become a legacy and a historic moment for us.
  “We also hope it will be something people talk about for a long time,” he said at a press conference recently.
  To further excite fans, the four will also be releasing a brand-new single in conjunction with the concert, centered around the theme of universal love and composed by Edry Abdul Halim.
  Anuar, who worked with Edry about 15 years ago on the hit song ‘Sedetik Lebih’, described him as a smart and experienced songwriter and composer.
  “When we met Edry, he gave us two song options. But one of them really captured our hearts. Without saying much, the four of us immediately agreed once we heard it,” he said.
  Anuar added that Edry understood the vocal characteristics of all four singers and crafted an arrangement that suited them well, which made the recording process smooth from start to finish.
  The concert will be directed by Jennifer Thompson while the music director is Lee Sze Wan. — Picture via ticket2u
  Organised by Anuar Zain Network in collaboration with Altus ProHouse, ‘Konsert Empat Live In Kuala Lumpur 2025’ is expected to be one of the most memorable music events of the year.
  Meanwhile, Ziana said the concert not only fulfills the dreams of loyal fans who have supported their artistic journeys but also marks a special moment for their family.
  “We want this concert to be the most meaningful moment in their (fans’) lives and ours too. Hopefully, it becomes a beautiful story to be remembered even when we are no longer here,” she said, adding the concert is expected to feature over 20 songs which they will perform solo or as a duet or group.
  Ernie, who grew up watching her uncle and aunt performing on stage, described the concert as a dream come true.
  “When I was told the concert was going to happen, I felt a mix of emotions – touched, overwhelmed and proud. This is a major moment in my life,” she said.
  The concert will be directed by Jennifer Thompson while the music director is Lee Sze Wan.
  Only 15 percent of the tickets for the concert are now remaining since they went on sale on April 25 and are available at www.ticket2u.com.my/empatkl. — Bernama

SEOUL, June 15 — Fans of South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun have publicly criticised a medical device company — identified only as Company A — for filing a court-ordered provisional seizure of his property, calling the move unjust and unethical.
  According to The Korea Times, Kim’s Korean and international fan union issued a statement on June 11 condemning the company’s actions. They claimed the process had exposed the actor’s personal information, calling it “a serious invasion of privacy” and “a clear case of secondary harm against a victim of false allegations”.
  The fan group accused the brand of capitalising on Kim’s public image while unfairly penalising him, despite his innocence. They argued that if reputational damage was at issue, legal action should be directed at those who spread false claims, not at the actor.
  They also called on the company to clarify its position and resolve the matter responsibly, warning that a failure to do so could lead to a widespread consumer boycott. “As consumers who became aware of your brand through Kim Soo-hyun, we hope this situation does not escalate into a boycott of all your products,” the statement read.
  The dispute centres on a 3 billion won (about RM9.3 million) provisional seizure request approved by the Seoul Eastern District Court in May, as reported by the Korean paper, targeting one of Kim’s luxury apartments in Galleria Foret, Seoul. The company had reportedly ended its endorsement deal with Kim and demanded compensation after his name was linked to a scandal involving the late actress Kim Sae-ron.
  Previous reports indicated the company pursued legal action after failing to recover damages from the terminated contract. Kim reportedly owns three high-end units in Galleria Foret, including a penthouse purchased in January 2024. The combined value of the properties is estimated at around 30 billion won.
  On June 12, Kim’s legal team at LKB & Partners confirmed the court-approved seizure but rejected all allegations raised by the YouTube channel Garo Sero Institute. “The allegations raised by Garo Sero are completely false. It is clear that Kim Soo-hyun is a victim of a crime, and it is deeply regrettable that he is now facing secondary harm,” the law firm stated.

SINGAPORE, June 15 — Singapore’s recent Covid-19 wave is on the decline, with the number of weekly infections dropping to about 15,300, down from a peak of 26,400 in late April, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.
  Describing the latest figures as “encouraging”, Ong noted in a Facebook post yesterday that the number of hospitalisations has also eased, falling to around 118 cases daily. 
  At the height of the wave, hospitals were handling approximately 174 Covid-19 patients a day.
  “The good news is that ICU (intensive care unit) cases remained consistently low throughout this wave, staying at just about two to three cases daily,” he said. 
  “This shows how our healthcare system has built up stronger resilience in managing Covid-19.”
  The minister also highlighted a drop in wastewater surveillance readings — a tool the authorities use to detect disease trends early. The falling levels add to evidence that the current wave is tapering off.
  However, Ong cautioned against complacency, noting that like seasonal influenza, future Covid-19 waves could still put significant pressure on healthcare resources.
  “We will keep monitoring the situation closely, particularly the emergence of new variants, and update the public accordingly,” he said, stressing the importance of continued vigilance and preparedness for future pandemics.

今年G7峰会在加拿大举行。（互联网照片）
（多伦多15日综合电）法新社报道，七大工业国家（
G7
）可能是个小型的菁英俱乐部，可是当G7领袖齐聚加拿大时，将有其他国家元首以贵宾身份出席，突显出G7为适应快速转变的世界所做的努力。
在全球动荡、以及美国对世界事务采取新的激进作法之际，来自印度、乌克兰、墨西哥、南非和韩国的领导人，名列一份精心挑选的贵宾名单之中。
ADVERTISEMENT
大西洋理事会的地缘经济中心专家阿南雅库玛说，G7的
峰会
邀请已成为一部份惯例，主办国通常喜欢作出“欢迎来到这个专属俱乐部”的态势。
她表示，领导人希望彼此见面，而且获邀贵宾将会参与大多数的会议。有些主办国“真心希望某些出席的贵宾能展现他们在全球经济的重要性。”
今年G7峰会在加拿大洛矶山脉登场之际，也是G7在全球GDP的占比从1992年的63％降至目前的44％，也适逢G7成员国在深思与中国和俄罗斯令人不安的关系。
库玛表示，去考量当他们作出这些决定时有谁在场，是件重要的事。
50年前，英国、法国、德国、意大利、日本与美国组成了六国集团（G6），首届会议在法国举行，加拿大隔年加入。
俄罗斯本身曾在1990年代初期获邀出席G7会议，并在1998年成为G8成员，2014年被踢出。
在获邀出席本届G7峰会的非成员国之中，包括受到瞩目的乌克兰。乌克兰总统泽连斯基将来到加拿大，作为G7持续广泛支持乌克兰对抗俄罗斯入侵的迹象，尽管存在着美国总统特朗普的怀疑态度。
泽连斯基旨在利用这次峰会，敦促美国对莫斯科采取更多制裁。
另一方面，日本政府披露，日本首席关税谈判代表赤泽亮正和美国商务部长卢特尼克周六通话30分钟，探讨了达成一项贸易协议的可能性。
赤泽周五（13日）也曾和卢特尼克、美国财长贝森特举行面对面会谈，并向媒体形容这次的会谈非常详尽，并朝向可能达成协议推进。
日本政府在声明中采用了类似措辞，形容赤泽和卢特尼克周六的协商“非常深入”，表示双方“探讨了达成一项互利协议的可能性。”
声明中说，这项谈判着眼于日本首相石破茂和特朗普计划在G7峰会场边举行的会谈。除非能够和美国敲定协议，否则日本从下月起面临24％关税。
此外，东京当局也在极力设法，让日本的汽车制造商能够豁免美国对汽车课征的25%关税。

，确保这两座甘榜更靠近城市，催化当地发展。
他说，新道路主要是缓解马当路交通拥挤，让居民减少对该道路的依赖。

“若砂政府能兴建马当emart通往舍格杜的新道路，我们也能同样衔接西里益，让甘榜西里益、甘榜巴洛与甘榜舍格杜更加紧密相连。”
阿邦佐哈里今日中午在西里益赛船盛会闭幕礼上致词时，如是表示。
他强调，只要居民继续大力支持砂盟，包括柏特拉再也区国会议员拿督斯里法迪拉，所有发展项目必定会逐步落实。
30英亩地建新住宅区
此外，为应对甘榜西里益与甘榜巴洛人口增长与房屋需求，阿邦佐哈里宣布在当地开发新住宅区，并采纳甘榜舍格杜模式，于两座甘榜之间约30英亩土地上兴建住宅区。
他说，甘榜西里益及甘榜巴洛人口逐渐增加，房屋需求日益迫切，砂土地及测量局将规划建造100间房屋，而砂政府将承担基础设施，包括道路、排水、电供与自来水等建设费用。
“这意味购屋者只需承担房屋价格，砂政府也将提供1万令吉房屋头期援助。若加上房屋及土地，每个购屋者将拥有至少35万令吉资产，大大改善经济水平。”
他说，扩展甘榜西里益及甘榜巴洛旨在协助当地年轻一代拥有属于自己的房屋，毕竟目前交通发达，人们不需要因为购买房屋而迁移至城市。

（关丹15日讯）关丹琼崖公会主席拿督陶启联指出，近期我国接连发生多起严重交通事故，显示改善道路安全措施已刻不容缓，政府应积极采取行动，以有效减少交通意外的发生。
他今日出席关丹琼崖公会2025年常年会员大会时提到，最近接二连三发生的交通事故包括联邦后备队罗里与载石罗里相撞酿成9人丧命车祸、东西大道一辆载有苏丹依德利斯教育大学（UPSI）学生的巴士翻覆导致15名学生身亡事故。事件震惊全国，也引起各界对重型车辆安全管理的高度关注。
ADVERTISEMENT
他表示，发生交通意外通常是多种因素的综合结果，包括道路环境，如路面湿滑、路面凹凸不平、坑洞或视线不清等，以及天气条件等，而车辆的技术状况，如刹车失灵或轮胎爆裂等，司机的行为，如疲劳驾驶、超速或酒后驾驶等都可以是酿成交通事故的原因。
“这不禁让我们感慨，改善道路安全措施，已经是刻不容迟的事情。政府应该积极采取措施，改善道路安全，以减少交通事故的发生，包括加强重型车辆的监管和检查。
他认为，政府也要加强道路安全教育，通过各种媒体渠道，向公众宣传道路安全知识，提高驾驶员的交通安全意识。
他表示，改善道路基础设施也很重要，因为道路老化、坑洞和路面不平整，也是导致交通事故频发的主要原因。
“地方政府等有关当局应对道路进行维护和升级，确保路面平整，减少路况不良导致的事故。设置清晰的交通标志和标线，提高驾驶员的辨识度。”
他说，车祸事故往往都是发生在环境昏暗，照明不佳的路段，因此改善夜间照明，增加道路照明灯，将有效降低车祸风险，提高夜间行车的安全性。
他也认为，驾驶人士必须时刻保持高度警觉，尤其是在市区或学校附近，应减速慢行，随时准备停车让行，以保障行人与骑士的安全。
“道路安全是一项长期而艰巨的任务，需要政府、企业和公众共同参与，才能取得显著成效。”
其他出席理事有法律顾问张慧玲、署理主席高荣宗、副主席吴多富、总务庄迪景、财政汤邦任、福利主任李蟠猷、妇女组主任李信桦、青年团团长吴桐万、康乐组主任戴䅉霖等人。

KOTA KINABALU: A Sabah lawyer has called for the introduction of caning as a punishment for corruption as current penalties are ineffective in deterring offenders.
  Parti Warisan legal advisor Chin Tek Ming launched an anti-corruption campaign along Gaya Street on Sunday (June 15), advocating for tougher laws including physical punishment for those found guilty of graft.
  As part of the campaign, Chin’s team displayed effigies labelled with signs such as "Severely Punish Corruption, Caning Awaits" and invited the public to strike the figures with rattan canes, an act that drew enthusiastic participation.
  He renewed his call for amendments to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (Act 694) to include caning as an additional penalty, citing the persistent emergence of high-profile corruption cases involving political leaders and civil servants.
  “The current provisions of imprisonment and fines are clearly ineffective. In China, penalties for bribery and corruption can go as far as the death penalty depending on severity,” he said.
  “Malaysia upholds human rights, so we’re not suggesting anything extreme. But at the very least, caning should be considered to serve as a strong deterrent,” added Chin.
  Former political secretary Pritchard Gumbaris and Yong Tain Vui both joined Chin, saying that stronger penalties need to be handed down to corrupt individuals.
  They said corruption by public officials is more damaging than theft as it not only cripples economic progress but also sends the wrong message to future generations.
  “This is an awakening campaign,” they said. “Corruption in our state is worsening, and the only way to curb it is by strengthening the law — including through the introduction of caning.”
  During the event, Chin also provided free legal consultation to the public.

Samling Group Achieves Major Gains In Eucalyptus Plantation Yields
BINTULU, June 15 (Bernama) -- Sarawak-based timber company, Samling Group, has achieved significant success with its tissue culture-derived Eucalyptus hybrid plantations, demonstrating potential to enhance both productivity and sustainability.
This success was revealed during a technical briefing by the company to the Forest Department Sarawak (FDS) recently, where the hybrid plantations have demonstrated over 50 per cent higher Mean Annual Increment (MAI) when compared to traditional seed-derived plantations.
“Looking ahead, Samling targets the production of 1.7 to 2.4 million plantlets in 2025/2026, with plans to scale up laboratory capacity to produce eight million plantlets annually, and eventually up to 25 million plantlets per year,” FDS said in a statement today.
It said this large-scale propagation aligns with Sarawak’s goal of achieving sustainable, high-performing, and commercially viable forest plantations.
The briefing was after an official visit by FDS director, Datuk Hamden Mohammad, to Samling Group's Plant Tissue Culture facilities in Bintulu recently.
The visit underscored the importance of innovation and strategic public-private partnerships to accelerate Sarawak’s forestry transformation.
The event was hosted by Samling Group chief operating officer, Yap Fui Fook, and joined by researchers from FDS and the company, the statement added.

ISTANBUL (dpa): Two hot air balloons crashed in central Turkey, killing at least one person and injuring 19 others, state broadcaster TRT reported on Sunday.
  The fatality was said to be one of the balloon pilots, while the injured were Indonesian tourists.
  The accident occurred during a flight that began in the scenic Ihlara Valley, part of the Cappadocia region - a major tourist destination known for its dramatic landscapes and balloon rides that draw hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.
  The pilot was forced to make a hard landing due to strong winds. He became entangled in ropes, fell under the balloon basket, and died, TRT quoted the provincial governor as saying. - dpa

KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 (Bernama) -- The Windhoek Islamic Centre has named its madrasah the Faizuddin Academy for Ilm and Dzikr in honour of the Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra Jamalullail.
  The naming was a culmination of an effort by the Charge d’Affaires of Malaysia to Namibia, Datuk Dr Mohamad Rameez Yahaya, in recognition of the Regent of Perlis’ contribution in kind and cash to the Windhoek Islamic Centre, which administers the affairs of the Muslim community in Namibia.
  Tuanku Syed Faizuddin’s two-year contribution included a soup kitchen to the needy after Friday prayers, said Rameez in a statement on Sunday.
  He added that the Regent of Perlis, through Universiti Islam Antarabangsa Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin (UniSIRAJ), would also provide scholarships to Namibian Muslim students to pursue their tertiary studies in Perlis, Malaysia beginning this September.
  Thus far, four Namibians have been accepted to pursue their Islamic tertiary studies at UniSIRAJ, said Rameez.
  At the naming ceremony, the chair conveyed a heartfelt gratitude from the Windhoek Islamic Centre to Malaysia - a non-Arab and non-African country - for its assistance since Islam took root in Namibia through its first batch of indigenous Muslim converts in 1979.
  Rameez hoped that the madrasah would serve as a starting point for the dissemination of Islamic teachings to help the people of Namibia understand Islam’s role in creating a united, peaceful, and harmonious society in Namibia.

  I’ve been married to my wife for almost three months now. Before we tied the knot, we were in a relationship for three years – we actually met on Tinder. 
  We share many things in common, which helped our love grow. However, we also frequently argue and have serious disagreements, often rooted in my past. 
  Before meeting my wife, I wasn’t exactly proud of my behaviour. After losing my first love in a tragic accident, I used casual relationships and an active sex life as a way to cope with the emotional pain. 
  Unfortunately, my wife discovered this part of my past by going through my phone. 
  Given that her previous partner cheated on her, she developed insecurities and a fear that I might do the same. 
  Wanting to earn her trust, I allowed her to go through my phone freely. 
  Initially, whenever she stumbled upon old messages, our arguments were minor. 
  Eventually, I even encouraged her to delete anything that upset her, as I had so much old data stored that doing it myself would take forever. I saw it as a form of teamwork, as if she were helping me erase my old life and move forward with her. 
  But over time, her frustration grew. Each time she came across something from my past, her anger intensified. 
  Her insecurities came back stronger, and I, in turn, struggled to accept that she still doubted me. 
  I’ve never cheated on her, and we’ve talked about this many times. Yet, every argument seems to circle back to the same issue – my past – and it tears me apart. 
  We’ve even discussed the possibility of divorce twice, but I’ve resisted because I deeply believe in our marriage. I still love her very much. She means the world to me, and I want nothing more than to grow old and spend the rest of my life with her. 
  However, every time she brings up my past, I find myself reacting with anger and frustration. What begins as a simple argument quickly escalates into a major fight. 
  Thelma, I’m reaching out because I’m trying everything I can to save this marriage. I don’t want to walk away from it. I don’t want to let it die. 
  What else can I do to rebuild her trust and truly move forward together? 
  SV 
  Thank you for your detailed explanation of events. I’m going to reframe them, so you have a clear perspective of the issue.
  You had an active sex life, met your partner, and settled down. However, your wife goes through your phone, acts as if you’re dishonest, and when you remind her that you are an open book, she insists you can’t be trusted and creates a fight.
  This is her problem, not yours.
  If your wife’s ex cheated, she has reason to distrust her ex. It has nothing to do with you.
  We all carry our past with us, but as adults we accept responsibility for the fears that come from previous experiences and we deal with it.
  Expecting future partners to take responsibility for the sins of past partners is unacceptable.
  The proper way forward for your wife is to go to counselling.
  Let her talk out her feelings, process her past and manage her behaviour in those sessions.
  Do not go with her! This is not a couple’s issue; it’s her issue.
  As for you, you allowed someone to define you as a bad character but there is no apparent foundation for it. You lost someone dear to you, and acted out by having lots of affairs. It’s a common reaction.
  It may have been more useful to talk it through with a grief counsellor but the awful thing about shock is that we can’t think straight. We often react blindly, and it’s only later that we wish we’d taken a different path.
  Perhaps you feel stigma because your comfort was sex instead of chocolate, exercise, work or some other preoccupation.
  But people who experience trauma are not themselves. Forgive yourself. If you cannot do that alone, talk to a counsellor specialising in trauma.
  Second, work on your self-esteem and set firm boundaries based on respect. You deserve common courtesy.
  The only time we allow others to snoop on our phones is when we have committed adultery.
  Even then, the period when we allow check-ins is short and part of an overall path of healing and recommitment.
  You have done nothing wrong! Therefore, nobody has the right to go through your phone.
  Your anger is a healthy sign because your body senses the injustice. You want to walk away because you are being attacked – another healthy sign.
  Not only that, but deleting messages and harassing you about your past are more huge red flags.
  I am concerned that you married a person who treats you so badly and who has little or no thought for your feelings.
  Therefore, I urge you to be careful.
  If you talk to your wife and she apologises, stops the behaviour immediately and seeks counselling for long-term change, then hopefully you can reset your relationship.
  But if she gaslights you, or tries to scare you with rage, then you may be in an abusive relationship. I say this because she treats you badly, accuses you of things you have not done, and uses rage to shut you down. These are all red flags.
  So be careful. And if you see more abusive behaviour, I urge you to speak to a counsellor skilled in abuse counselling.
  Again, go alone – toxic and abusive partners hijack couples counselling by twisting the narrative, deflecting responsibility, and manipulating both you and the therapist.
  I suspect you will be worried once you’ve read my response, for you are only just married, but I urge you to take steps now.
  You deserve to be treated with courtesy, kindness and respect.
  Good luck and know I’m thinking of you.

”（Legion of Honour）。
法新社报道，这位右翼前总统2007年至2012年执政，大选惨败卸任以来就官司缠身。

去年，上诉法院维持对萨尔科齐贪污和滥权的有罪判决，要配戴电子脚镣1年，不需入狱服刑。
萨尔科齐是第2位被撤销有关勋章的前国家元首。第1位是与纳粹合作的菲利普贝当。贝当1945年8月因通敌叛国而被判罪成。
萨尔科齐的电子脚镣已在本月移除，目前利用仅存的最后一条法律向欧洲人权法院上诉，为自己辨护。

PARIS (Reuters) -Former president Nicolas Sarkozy has been stripped of his Legion of Honour, France's highest distinction, after being convicted of corruption and influence peddling last year, according to a decree published in Sunday's Official Bulletin.
  The centre-right politician has been embroiled in legal battles since leaving office in 2012.
  Last year, France's highest court upheld his conviction for corruption and influence peddling, ordering him to wear an electronic tag for a year, a first for a former French head of state.
  Also last year, an appeals court confirmed a separate conviction for illegal campaign financing in his failed re-election bid in 2012.
  The rules of the Legion of Honour award meant that the revocation had been expected.

(Reuters) -Al Ahly midfielder Emam Ashour will miss the remainder of the 2025 Club World Cup after scans confirmed he had suffered a broken collarbone, the Egyptian club announced on Sunday.
  Ashour left the opening match of the revamped competition against Inter Miami, which ended in a goalless draw, in tears after injuring his shoulder.
  "Medical examinations on Emam Ashour in a Miami hospital showed he sustained a broken collarbone, and he will miss the remaining matches in the Club World Cup," Al Ahly doctor Ahmed Gaballah said via the club's account on X.
  Ashour, who had previously suffered a serious shoulder injury while playing for the Egyptian national team in 2024, initially fell early in the game and received treatment on the sidelines before returning briefly and missing a one-on-one chance.
  However, the 27-year-old Egyptian Premier League top scorer was unable to continue and asked to be substituted in the 14th minute, being replaced by Ahmed Sayed (Zizo).

(Reuters) -Batter Marnus Labuschagne is still a key part of Australia's future in test cricket despite failing to impress in their five-wicket defeat to South Africa in the World Test Championship final, coach Andrew McDonald said.
  Labuschagne opened alongside Khawaja, scoring 17 runs off 56 balls in the first innings and 22 off 64 in the second, with South Africa completing a remarkable turnaround on Saturday after successfully chasing down an imposing 282-run target. 
  The 30-year-old has scored one hundred in his last 28 tests and has come away with single-digit tallies in four of his last 11 matches.
  "He's a big part of the future of the team. Anyone that averages 45, 46 in test cricket at that age is important. We've got older players there that are closer to the end than the start," McDonald told reporters.
  "We've got some younger players that are coming in. If he can get his game in good order for the next four or five years, he can underpin that batting order. But at the moment, he'd be disappointed with the returns. He's missed out on big scores. 
  "But we're confident that he could return to his best and hence why we keep picking him. And at what point do we stop picking him? I think most players across their journey get dropped at some point in time..."
  Khawaja also struggled against South Africa, departing for a duck in the first innings and scoring just six runs in his second, but McDonald said the 38-year-old veteran's presence in the team was invaluable.
  "He's on contract, he's an important player. He gives us stability at his best at the top. And we like to look at our players at their best," McDonald said.
  "No doubt, a couple of failures here and people then start to talk about maybe it's the end. I don't see an end date with the way he's training, the way he's preparing, the way he's moving."
  Australia next travel to the Caribbean for a three-test series against West Indies beginning on June 25.

LONDON (Reuters) -Steve Smith will miss Australia’s first test against the West Indies in Barbados later this month and could sit out the entire three-test series with a finger injury, captain Pat Cummins said.
  Smith, one of the mainstays of the Australian team, suffered a compound dislocation of his right little finger fielding on the third day of the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord’s on Friday, missing the rest of the match.
  He was taken to hospital for x-rays but no surgery was required. However, he faces some time on the sidelines.
  "I'd say first test maybe unlikely, and then go from there, but it's a bit early to tell," Cummins said after Australia's surprise defeat against a South Africa team that wrapped up their five-wicket victory on Saturday.
  The 36-year-old Smith was standing far closer to the stumps than normal when he dropped South Africa captain Temba Bavuma, who had scored two runs but went on to hit 66 in a significant contribution to his team’s success.
  Australia begin their three-test series in the Caribbean in Bridgetown over June 25-29 and play the other two tests in Grenada and Jamaica.

相信是断截的水管阻碍排水系统，不过承包商指该水管只是铺路时为了稳固结构所设的临时措施，所以随着铺路工程已完成，已移走有关水管。（高建业摄）

有关，如今承包商已着手处理将水管移走。
巴生市议员颜友鹰指出，雪州水务管理公司于去年耗资400万令吉，在南德园“激活”一个搁置约30年的旧蓄水池，同时涵盖接驳新的地下水管和重铺受影响的道路，整个工程约1年时间。

他说，如今工程几近完成，结果市民发现路上经常出现积水的问题，于是向巴生王城市政厅进行投诉，要求市政厅派人查看。
颜友鹰：雪州水务管理公司已派人将断截水管取出，相信很快可以解决积水问题。（高建业摄）
“市政厅勘查后发现，地下排水系统内的两段断截水管疑是导致排水不畅的主因，已指示雪州水务管理公司尽快将其移除。
他说，雪州水务管理公司的承包商解释，由于道路下方设有一条横跨的排水沟，为避免施工期间路面塌陷，临时以断截水管作为支撑结构，但在工程完成后未及时拆除，才导致排水受阻。
“如今铺路工程已完成，承包商着手处理移走断截水管的事宜。”
他说，雪州水供管理公司一直致力提升水供素质，而激活一个被搁置多年的旧蓄水池也是该公司的其中一项努力，希望为居民提供更优质的水供服务。”
“当地现有的蓄水槽和南德园之间有一段颇远的距离，惟该蓄水槽是在山坡上，因此重启后，可以大大提升当地的水压。”
他说，一旦面对断水问题时，上述蓄水槽也可以为居民供应多一天的用水量，将大大缓解居民在断水时所受到的影响。

The groups said giving domestic workers a weekly off day will protect them from exploitation, confinement, and abuses.
KUALA LUMPUR
:
Several groups have urged the government to mandate a compulsory weekly day off for domestic workers.
They say implementing an uninterrupted day off for these workers will protect them from exploitation, confinement, and abuses.
The groups include the Association of Nationalist Overseas Filipino Workers in Malaysia (AMMPO), the Indonesian Migrant Domestic Workers Association (Pertimig), the International Domestic Workers Federation (IDWF), and non-profit NGO Our Journey.
They said a recent survey by AMMPO, Pertimig, and IDWF showed that nearly all of the participants were deprived of a weekly day off, with nearly half of them working seven days a week.
The survey, which covered 108 individuals, also reported that 15% of the workers experienced physical violence, threats, or verbal abuse when they requested a day off.
“We urge the government and employers to take concrete action by enacting a mandatory weekly day off for domestic workers,” the groups said at an event today in conjunction with International Domestic Workers Day, which falls on June 16 each year.
They also urged the government to provide domestic workers with the full scope of labour standards afforded to other sectors by removing the exclusion in the First Schedule under the 1955 Employment Act.
They said the government should introduce a standard employment contract and ensure that migrant domestic workers are not asked to bear the recruitment costs.
Renewed calls were also made for the government to introduce a standalone legislation to protect domestic workers and ratify the ILO Domestic Workers Convention 2011.
M Ramachelvam, co-chairman of the Bar Council’s Migrants, Refugees and Immigration Affairs Committee said a separate law for domestic workers should be enacted to cater to the differences between domestic work and the formal sector.
He suggested that the government standardise employment contracts and issue regulations for domestic work.
“These are within the powers of the human resources minister without needing to table them in Parliament. This is something the minister should look into immediately,” he said.
Ramachelvam urged the government to introduce mechanisms to allow foreign domestic workers to change their employers or sectors.
He said the government should also regulate the employment of domestic workers as part-time cleaners to avoid labour rights abuse. Currently, he said, any injury happening at a commercial workplace is not protected by the domestic worker’s social security insurance.
“Employers are hiring several domestic workers and sending them out to work as part-time cleaners in several houses, but they should not be exploited this way. There should be regulations on these part-time arrangements,” he said.
On June 12, migrant rights group Tenaganita urged the government to introduce a separate domestic workers law following the rescue of an abused Indonesian woman from a house.
------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR: Legal gaps in protecting foreign domestic workers in Malaysia leave them vulnerable to potential abuse by employers, say migrant worker rights groups.
  They are urging the government to recognise the role played by over 100,000 domestic workers in Malaysia by implementing several proposals, including a mandatory 24-hour off-day each week.
  The groups said in a statement on Sunday (June 15) that the weekly day off is a right of foreign domestic workers that is not always extended.
  The statement was signed by the Association of Nationalist Overseas Filipino Workers (AMMPO), Indonesian Domestic Workers Association (Pertimig), Our Journey (Malaysia), and the International Domestic Workers Federation (IDWF).
  According to a survey by IDWF, Pertimig and AMMPO, almost all migrant domestic workers surveyed in Malaysia, or 95% out of 108 total respondents, were deprived of weekly days off.
  The survey also found that 15% of the workers surveyed experienced physical violence, threats, or verbal abuse, or a combination thereof, from employers when they requested a day off.
  On a related matter, Datuk Seri M. Ramachelvam of the Bar Council said that despite several legal reforms, foreign domestic workers were still deprived of some basic rights.
  Speaking at the International Domestic Workers Day celebrations here on Sunday, he said this group of workers was not covered by changes to the Employment Act 1955 that came into force in 2023, such as fewer weekly working hours and increased maternity leave.
  The Bar Council's migrants, refugees and immigration affairs committee co-chairman said there should be a separate law enacted specifically for foreign domestic workers to safeguard their rights.
  “Domestic worker legislation is imperative. That's something that the government needs to look into seriously.
  “The other area that the government needs to look at is the work conditions, to ensure that these are humane, comply with international standards and norms, and that there is no exploitation,” he added.
  Ramachelvam also urged the Human Resources Ministry to introduce standardised job contracts and regulations covering foreign domestic workers.
  “The government can issue regulations on domestic workers, which is within the powers of the minister, without going to Parliament,” he added.

注册即将于今日（15日）截止，日前该集团共收到360份“漂白”申请。
该集团将在注册截止后，第一时间把把相关申请，提交给彭亨州政府秘书机构（PSK）处理。
ADVERTISEMENT
该集团执行董事文永坤今日接受星洲日报访问时说，集团会速战速决，尽快完成收集农民注册“漂白”的名单，解决农民面对的问题。
“虽然今日是周日假期，但是本集团位于都赖路的办事处仍然开放给农民进行注册事宜。
“自4月21日重新开放予农民进行注册漂白以来，已接近两个月，我们必须把握时间尽快提呈给州政府秘书机构进行处理。”
他指出，目前注册360名农民，所涉及的无地契
榴梿
芭面积介于2500至3000英亩之间，土地测量还在进行中。
“目前本集团获得州政府授权租借的无地契芭，包括州政府土地及永久森林保留地，大约6000英亩。”
他指出，种植榴梿并不容易，农民最熟悉他们榴梿树的状况，因此也只有农民亲自照顾，才能有肥美的果实及好收成。
另一方面，虽然抢救猫山王联盟（猫联）两星期前公开表态考虑与彭亨皇家榴梿集团庭外和解，但是至今为止，彭亨皇家榴梿集团还未收到对方的庭外和解通知。
文永坤说，猫联的律师还没有与该集团的律师接触，或者发出信函，以便结束双方的司法战。

早市巴刹部分摊位将会暂时获搬迁至美拉4路继续营业，即投注店前的道路。
（蒲种15日讯）
梳邦再也市政厅
将从明天起至10月15日，在蒲种山庄早市巴刹现址的美拉2路（Jalan Merak 2）及美拉2A路分阶段进行为期4个月的
维修
和
重铺
道路工程
，受影响的部分摊位将会先后暂时搬迁至后方的美拉4路。
梳邦再也市政厅官员，包括执照组助理官员（行政）莫哈末阿里早前派发通告给小贩和商家，文告内容除了提及有关工程，也提醒商家和小贩在当局施工期间，不要在涉及路段停车，以让当局顺利施工，并整顿临时摊格。
ADVERTISEMENT
蒲种贩商企业联合会主席李广隆指出，市政厅早前已经提早通知小贩会进行提升道路工程，好让商贩做好准备，官员已也和该联合会代表开会。
莫哈末阿里（右二）在日前派发通告给小贩，提醒他们在工程施工期间的注意事项。右是李广隆。左二是黄暐淇。
李广隆：工程涉及挖掘 耗时费工
李广隆接受《大都会》社区报记者采访时表示，市政厅会分阶段在美拉2路（Jalan Merak 2）及美拉2A路提升道路，其中一条道路会铺砖头，另一条则是铺柏油，以美化环境，使道路更耐用和安全。
他表示，早市巴刹的道路凹凸不平，之前也发生过民众和年长者步行时不慎摔伤，相当危险，而且下雨时还会积水。
因此，小贩均对市政厅重铺道路感到欢迎。不过，李广隆表示，他也询问官员为何工程要耗时长达4个月，对方的回应是指工程涉及挖路、重铺和种种规划与程序，因此耗时较长。
李广隆表示，市政厅将会安排受影响的档口暂时迁移至旁边的道路，或后方的美拉4路继续营业。
部分道路已出现损坏和凹凸不平，若行人一不小心，可能就会因此摔倒受伤。
黄暐淇：受影响档口暂迁美拉4路
蒲种贩商企业联合会秘书黄暐淇表示，蒲种山庄早市巴刹共有128个小贩摊位，在分阶段进行道路提升工程期间，市政厅会安排受影响的小贩暂时搬迁至后方道路（投注店前的道路）继续摆档。
她坦言，小贩都会担心顾客流失，但她呼吁大家保持耐心和配合。
黄暐淇表示，早市巴刹的道路出现许多坑洞、凹凸不平，其年迈的母亲早前就因此不慎跌倒受伤，甚至住院10天。
“这些坑洞积水，而且有大小车辆和罗里频密出入，加速道路损坏的状况，因此需要当局提升。”
蒲种山庄早市巴刹目前共有128个小贩摊位，随着市政厅将分阶段展开道路提升工程，部分摊位将会暂时迁移至另一条道路继续摆摊。

（红土坎15日马新社讯）首相兼财长拿督斯里安华今日宣布，政府拨款推动今年在红土坎海军基地展开的数个项目，以提升皇家海军人员的福祉。
  他说，政府将拨款6500万令吉在基地内兴建专科诊疗综合楼，以及提升武装部队医院，并已要求州秘书尽速落实。

  他今日配合霹雳州2025年昌明大马人民计划，出席红土坎海军亲民宴活动致词时，这么说。
  安华提到，之前红土坎海军基地已成功实施多项维修项目，包括淡水输水系统、建设国家学前教育计划儿童中心（PAPN）、修复武吉柏威拉斜坡、为弹药与炸药库安装防雷系统、全面维修A33、A37、A16和A22家庭住宅和作业码头疏浚工程。

LUMUT: The Perak government is requesting increased federal assistance to boost infrastructure and industrial growth, especially in key industrial zones and the rare earth element (REE) sector.
  Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Saarani Mohamad said sustainable economic growth in Perak hinges on robust connectivity and strategic investment incentives.
  He hoped Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim would consider increasing federal allocations for infrastructure upgrades and new investment schemes.

  “To ensure sustainable growth, we are appealing to the Prime Minister to consider funding the development of infrastructure in key industrial areas, along with new investment incentives that can help Perak attract more investors,” he said in his speech before Anwar closed the Madani Rakyat programme at the Lumut Waterfront here on Sunday (June 15).
  Saarani said the success of industrial hubs such as the Lumut Maritime Industrial City (LuMIC) is closely tied to efficient transport infrastructure, including wider roads and an integrated rail network for cargo and passenger movement.
  “There is a pressing need for better road systems and rail connectivity to link Lumut with other major towns,” he added.

  Saarani also emphasised the state’s aspirations in the REE sector.
  He said as a pioneer in REE mining, Perak is working to become a key player in the downstream segment of the mineral industry.
  “We support the Prime Minister’s vision of making Perak a leading player in this sector.
  “The state has launched various initiatives to build a complete REE industry value chain, from upstream to downstream,” he said.
  ALSO READ:  Perak revives mining glory 
  He expressed hope that the Federal Government would back efforts to establish a midstream and downstream REE ecosystem in Perak, positioning the state as a regional hub for mineral production.
  “Perak has the potential to be not just Malaysia’s top mineral producer, but a major contributor in the region as well,” Saarani said.

ROME, June 15 — Italian millennial Carlo Acutis, dubbed “God’s Influencer”, will be elevated to sainthood in September after the original ceremony was delayed by Pope Francis’s death in April, the Vatican said Friday.
  Pope Leo XIV rescheduled to September 7 the canonisation of Acutis, who died of leukaemia in 2006 at the age of 15. He had been set to be made a saint on April 27.
  Nicknamed the “Cyber Apostle”, the teenager had an ardent faith from a young age and used his computer skills to spread the Catholic faith online, notably creating a digital exhibition on miracles.
  Italian student Pier Giorgio Frassati (1901-1925), renowned for his social commitment and passion for mountain climbing, will be canonised on the same day.
  Leo will raise seven others to sainthood on October 19.
  They include Papua New Guinea’s first saint, Pierre To Rot, a lay catechist executed by Japan in 1945, Ignace Shoukrallah Maloyan, an archbishop who died in 1915 and the Venezuelan “doctor of the poor” Jose Gregorio Hernandez Cisneros, who died in 1919. — AFP

FILEM Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam 2 (PHSM2) arahan sutradara Datin Paduka Shuhaimi Baba dihasilkan pada 2005 susulan kejayaan filem pertama yang menjengah pawagam tahun sebelumnya.
  Filem kedua dikukuhkan dengan penampilan beberapa pelakon hebat antaranya Rushdi Ramli yang menghidupkan watak Zali atau Joyo.
  Persembahan lakonan Rushdi dalam filem itu meninggalkan kesan sehingga membuatkan beliau tercalon dalam kategori Pelakon Lelaki Terbaik sempena Festival Filem Malaysia ke-19.
  Kesempatan berbual dengan Rushdi baru-baru ini memberi peluang kepada saya untuk mengorek cerita menarik di sebalik pembabitannya dalam filem berkenaan.
  Antara kisah yang tidak diketahui ramai adalah mengenai kecederaan mata yang dialami Rushdi sewaktu sesi latihan yang diadakan dua minggu sebelum penggambaran PHSM2 bermula.
  “Saya beberapa kali melibas tali cemeti untuk mendapatkan bunyinya ketika latihan. Tiba-tiba ekor tali cemeti itu melantun sebelum terkena sebelah mata saya.
  “Petang itu saya terus dikejarkan ke hospital, doktor arahkan saya jalani pembedahan untuk mengelakkan kecederaan menjadi lebih teruk.
  “Menurut doktor, bola mata saya mengalami kebocoran dan jika tidak dibedah, cecair akan keluar dari luka selain anak mata mungkin berubah kedudukan.
  “Saya lega sebab sebelah mata saya dapat diselamatkan kerana cepat bertindak. Menurut doktor, jika lambat dibedah, sebelah mata saya mungkin buta,” kongsinya.
  Khabar angin kencang bertiup mengenai perancangan Shuhaimi untuk menghasilkan edisi ketiga filem tersebut. Namun tiada kepastian ditemukan sehingga ke titik ini.
  Rushdi bagaimanapun menyatakan kesediaan sekiranya diberi peluang untuk muncul dalam filem tersebut.
  “Shuhaimi hanya akan berkongsi perkara yang pasti. Buat masa ini belum ada ketetapan mengenai filem tersebut. 
  “Jika filem itu disambung pun, saya tak pasti sama ada saya terlibat atau tidak kerana dalam filem kedua, karakter saya mati.
  “Saya tidak tahu perancangan pengarah dan penulis cerita kerana kalau ada keperluan, watak yang dimatikan, boleh diadakan semula.
  “Tapi, misal kata filem itu disambung dan watak saya dihidupkan semula, saya tidak akan menolak jika ditawarkan kerana saya senang bekerja dengan pasukan produksi Shuhaimi,” katanya.
  DIEJEK KERANA MAK 
  RUSHDI dilahirkan dan membesar di Ulu Klang, Selangor. Beliau tidak menafikan terkena tempias populariti ibunya, Norlia Ghani yang ketika itu sudah pun mencipta nama dalam dunia lakonan.
  “Saya tidak merasakan yang saya berbeza dengan kanak-kanak lain hanya disebabkan ibu bapa saya orang seni.
  “Tetapi tidak dinafikan saya juga terkena tempias populariti ibu yang mana ketika saya bersekolah, dia sudah terkenal dengan watak Joyah menerusi drama Opah.
  “Disebabkannya saya selalu diejek di sekolah, sehinggakan saya persoalkan kenapa ibu saya ini jadi pelakon, bukan suri rumah macam mak orang lain. Tapi iyalah, masa itu saya masih budak dan belum matang.
  “Tapi masa itu saya sedar betapa popularnya ibu saya sehinggakan orang lain tidak lagi memanggilnya dengan nama sebenarnya, sebaliknya nama karakter tersebut,” ceritanya. 
  Meskipun dilahirkan dalam keluarga seni, Rushdi pada awalnya tidak pernah merancang untuk mengikut jejak langkah orang tuanya menjadi pelakon.
  Malah, pelakon yang sekarang berusia 54 tahun ini ketika zaman kanak-kanaknya tidak selesa kehidupan selebriti yang sentiasa menjadi tumpuan masyarakat.
  “Ibu saya memang peramah, sentiasa melayan peminat yang mahu mengambil gambar dan minta tandatangan.
  “Cuma semasa kecil, saya tidak selesa menjadi tumpuan apabila berada di tempat awam. Saya ini orangnya cukup menjaga privasi,” kongsinya.
  PELAKON KAYU 
  RUSHDI menerima tawaran membintangi filem Sumpah Mahsuri arahan sutradara Datuk Jamil Sulong sebagai pelakon ekstra selepas beliau tamat persekolahan sekitar penghujung era 80-an.
  Tidak berniat terjun ke bidang lakonan, pembabitan awalnya didorong oleh keinginan untuk sekadar mendapatkan wang tambahan.
  “Sebenarnya, saya memang tidak mahu berlakon kerana saya tahu saya ini tak berbakat. Tapi disebabkan wang, saya cuba. 
  “Dalam filem Sumpah Mahsuri, saya dibayar sebanyak RM1,500 selaku pelakon ekstra yang tidak berdialog. 
  “Ketika itu, saya ‘kayu’ berlakon. Sampaikan pengarah terpaksa memberikan dialog saya kepada pelakon lain iaitu Din Glamor.
  “Tapi masa itu seronok sebab saya berpeluang berjumpa pelakon A lister antaranya Mahmud June, Datuk Rosnani Jamil, Yusof Wahab dan ramai lagi,” kongsinya.
  Rushdi semakin dikenali menerusi drama televisyen antaranya Pendekar yang ditayangkan di TV1 pada 1992 dan 1993.
  “Watak saya dalam drama itu asalnya ditawarkan kepada pelakon, Ebby Saiful. Entah kenapa Ebby sendiri yang bertanyakan sama ada saya berminat atau tidak untuk menggantikannya. 
  “Saya pula tidak bekerja waktu itu, jadi saya bersetuju untuk hadir uji bakat. Namun ditakdirkan Tuhan, saya terpilih walaupun saya masih belum mahir berlakon.
  “Kebetulan pula pihak produksi terdesak untuk segera mendapatkan pelakon sebelum penggambaran bermula,” katanya.
  WARIS JARI HANTU 
  RUSHDI segera menyebut karakter Shariman dalam filem Waris Jari Hantu apabila ditanya kepada beliau watak apakah paling meninggalkan kesan sepanjang karier lakonannya. 
  Aktor ini mengakui bukan mudah baginya membawa watak ‘Mak Nyah’ yang kontroversi ketika itu.
  Tapi, ternyata keputusannya tepat dan kerja kerasnya dalam menghidupkan watak berkenaan dibayar dengan trofi Pelakon Lelaki Terbaik di Festival Filem Malaysia ke-20.
  “Individu pertama yang saya rujuk untuk minta pandangan sama ada okey atau tidak saya bawa watak Mak Nyah adalah anak saya yang ketika itu berusia 11 tahun.
  “Sebab saya faham perasaan anak kalau mak ayah mereka yang bekerja sebagai pelakon melakonkan watak yang mungkin akan memberi kesan kepada anak-anak.
  “Walaupun anak saya melarang, saya terima juga watak itu mengenangkan kalau saya menolak ibarat menidakkan peluang yang menjadi rebutan ramai pelakon ketika itu.
  “Saya anggap ia satu rezeki kerana karakter tersebut belum pernah wujud dalam mana-mana filem pada waktu tersebut,” jelasnya.
  Kata Rushdi, dia mengambil lebih satu bulan membuat persediaan sebelum memulakan penggambaran.
  “Demi menghidupkan watak Mak Nyah, saya kena melakukan kajian dan pengamatan. Antara lokasi yang saya pergi adalah tempat-tempat di mana golongan Mak Nyah membuat persembahan.
  “Boleh kata watak ini paling menyeksa saya kerana selama empat bulan penggambaran saya memakai baju dan skirt, kasut dan bersolek macam perempuan.
  “Tapi saya rasa usaha itu berbaloi apabila kerja keras saya diiktiraf dengan sebuah trofi FFM,” ujarnya.

Pakatan Harapan Youth has criticised PAS Youth for changing the theme of its upcoming rally - initially aimed at opposing the Urban Renewal Act (URA) - into a demonstration calling for Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s resignation.

Harapan Youth chief Woo Kah Leong said the shift proves that PAS and Perikatan Nasional are opposing simply for the sake of doing so, without any clear stance or direction on public policy.

Young Malaysian Chinese are reluctant to have a family
Exports say the norm now is that the married ones are not having babies and those who remain single are not getting married and even if they are, they are not keen to have babies
Dragon is an auspicious and powerful icon in Chinese custom where Chinese parents are fond of having babies in the Year of Dragon.
Nevertheless, such phenomenon has changed as the figures released by the Department of Statistics in 2024, which is the year of dragon, shows otherwise.
Chinese babies born in the year of dragon is even lower than the previous year, which is the year of rabbit.
A total of 29,585 Chinese babies were born in 2024, 4,088 less than the previous year.
In a survey conducted by Goh Soo Khoon, associate professor at the Centre for Policy Research and International Studies, Universiti Sains Malaysia, the outcome indicates that Malaysian Chinese prefer to remain single and those married opt not to have babies.
The young Malaysian Chinese also do not care about the decline in Chinese population and they do not see themselves getting involved –  increase the population by getting married and have a family.
A total of 22.5 per cent of Chinese respondents who participated in a survey plan to get married but 28.47 per cent of them indicate that they have no plan to have children while 46 per cent of them are unsure and 31.5 per cent plan to remain single.
Of the three ethnic groups, 62.62 per cent of the Malays confirm that they want to get married and only 6.67 per cent of them do not have plan to marry.
For Indians, 46 per cent have plans to get married, 34 per cent are unsure and 20 per cent opt not to get married.
Goh said the differences in percentage highlight the need to conduct a deeper level of research on the impact of culture, economy and social in marriage perception affecting different ethnic groups.
For respondents who plan to get married, Goh probed further in the survey on whether they are having children and the number of children they plan to have.
A total of 95.92 per cent of the Malays are clear about having babies, followed by Indians where 90 per cent of them plan to have a family. Only 71.53 per cent of Chinese plan to have babies, she said.
On number of children, Goh said Malays are inclined to have a bigger family where 50.27 per cent of them opt to have two or more children while 65.31 per cent of Chinese stick to two and 13.78 per cent of Chinese prefer to have more than two.
For Indians, 52.78 per cent of the respondents opt for two children and 20.83 per cent opt for more than two.
“Majority of the Chinese are only keen to have two children. In contrast, more Malays and Indians are willing to have more than two children,’’ she said.
Goh highlighted that 28.47 per cent of Chinese respondents indicate they do not plan to have children while only 4.08 per cent of Malays and 10 per cent of Indians have the same plan.
The survey proved that the decline in fertility rates is related to the plunge in marriage rates. It is also closely related to one’s choice in family and lifestyle.
The survey was participated by 920 people – 420 Malays, 400 Chinese and 100 Indian aged between 20 and 45 in Penang and Prai.

(Reuters) -Waikato Chiefs coach Clayton McMillan is refusing to be overawed by the prospect of facing the Canterbury Crusaders in their Christchurch stronghold when the teams face off in the Super Rugby Pacific final later this week.
  The Crusaders have won 31 consecutive playoff matches on home soil in the competition over the last three decades and will take on the Chiefs on June 21 after handing the Auckland Blues a 21-14 defeat on Friday.
  The Chiefs, who finished on top of the regular season standings, defeated the ACT Brumbies 37-17 in the semi-finals on Saturday to advance to a third consecutive decider, prompting McMillan to dismiss concerns over the Crusaders' home record.
  "We don't have any fear about going down to Christchurch and playing the Crusaders," he said. "We're one team that's had our fair share of success down there. 
  "We know it's not going to be easy. They've got a formidable record and they're a quality team and they demonstrated that (against the Blues). 
  "You've got to be at your best, you've got to take every opportunity that presents itself and the best team on the day will win.
  "It's a hostile reception down there no matter when you go, first round of the year or the final. We're pretty accustomed to that and we can generate some energy off that."
  The Chiefs' confidence will be boosted by the 35-19 win they secured over the Crusaders in May, although a defeat to the Blues in the first round of playoffs saw McMillan's side surrender their home field advantage in the final.    
  McMillan will send his players into the decider determined that they work as a team rather than as individuals to claim the title for the first time since 2013. 
  "We've got to embrace the opportunity that's directly in front of us and we've got to get down to get it done," he said. "There won't be any one (person) that will do that, it will be the collective.
  "Our Achilles heel in the past has been that we've wanted something so bad that it becomes detrimental sometimes. You try a little bit too hard. 
  "All we have to do is back ourselves and do what we've done all year; play Chiefs rugby, work hard for each other, nail the small moments, apply enough pressure on the Crusaders that they feel that pressure.
  "If you win enough of those, you give yourself enough of a chance of walking away with the title."

WASHINGTON, June 15 — A shooting at a protest against President Donald Trump’s policies in the western state of Utah left one person with “life-threatening injuries,” police said, adding that three others were taken into custody.
  Police said the incident occurred around 8pm yesterday (0200 GMT Sunday/10am Malaysian time Sunday) in Utah’s capital Salt Lake City during a protest that drew about 10,000 people — one of several “No Kings” demonstrations across the United States rallying against Trump.
  “We can confirm the shooting resulted in one person being critically injured. The patient has been taken to a hospital with life-threatening (injuries),” said the Salt Lake City police department in a social media post, adding that they had “a person of interest in custody.”
  Police Chief Brian Redd stressed during a news conference that the events leading up to the shooting “were very peaceful,” adding that the first person taken in custody had a gunshot wound and was transported to the hospital.
  Two other individuals involved in the incident were also taken into custody, he said.
  “At this time, there is... no ongoing threats to the public,” Redd said, adding that it was too early in their investigation to say if the shooting was politically motivated.
  City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said “this act of violence does not define” Salt Lake City — a Democratic bastion in the deep-red Republican state of Utah.
  “The purpose of today’s demonstration was a powerful and peaceful expression until this event and that cannot be overshadowed or silenced by a single act meant to harm,” she said.
  “We are a nation that needs our First Amendment right, we deserve to protest in peace. And what happened today I hope will not silence the voices of the public who deserve to have their voices heard.” — AFP

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Congress on Thursday he would involve lawmakers in a 30-day assessment of the Aukus alliance, a day after the future of the three-country security pact was thrown into question by reports that the Pentagon was putting it under review.
  “Congress will be involved,” Hegseth said in response to a question from US congressman Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat, who also raised concern about the time frame allocated for analysing the pact between Australia, Britain and the US.
  “A 30-day review on a project that really took years to develop?” Courtney asked during a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee, while noting that China’s dislike of Aukus was the alliance’s “ultimate sort of endorsement”.
  Asked about Aukus in Beijing on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said China opposed “manufacturing bloc confrontation and anything that amplifies the risk of nuclear proliferation and exacerbates [an] arms race”.
  Aukus was launched in 2021 under then-US president Joe Biden and is widely viewed as an alliance to counter China’s regional influence and ambitions.
  For Australia, the bloc affords an opportunity to acquire and build nuclear-powered submarines and join the ranks of just six other countries with such capability.
  The partnership is also key to Britain’s planned expansion of its attack submarine fleet.
  Washington, meanwhile, views it as a way to boost its submarine shipyards and speed up lagging production rates of Virginia-class submarines.
  Ahead of Thursday’s hearing, officials from Britain and Australia issued statements playing down concerns that the US would not follow through with the pact.
  In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Richard Marles, Australia’s defence minister, said news of the review was not surprising and that he expected Aukus to continue.
  “This is a multi-decade plan,” he explained. “There will be governments that come and go, and I think whenever we see a new government, a review of this kind is going to be something which will be undertaken.”
  In a similar vein, a British defence ministry spokesperson said it was “understandable that a new administration would want to review its approach to such a major partnership, just as the UK did last year”.
  The spokesperson added that Britain would “continue to work closely with the US and Australia ... to maximise the benefits and opportunities” of the pact.
  A Pentagon official on Wednesday said the Donald Trump administration was reviewing Aukus to make sure it was “aligned” with the president’s America-first agenda.
  Hegseth at Thursday’s hearing said he and Elbridge Colby, US undersecretary of defence for policy, were involved in the review.
  Colby had previously expressed concern that the US would lose submarines to Australia at a time when it was critical to deter China militarily.
  The questioning of Hegseth came days before a Group of Seven summit in Canada, where Trump, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer were expected to convene amid growing concern that Washington was upending longstanding alliances.
  Hegseth, meanwhile, declined at Thursday’s hearing to answer directly when asked by lawmakers whether the Trump administration had plans to take Panama and Greenland by military force.
  “The American people would want the Pentagon to have plans for any particular contingency,” Hegseth said.
  Panama was “very key terrain that we focus on”, he added, while noting the US looked forward to “working with Greenland to ensure that it is secured from any potential threats”.
  Earlier this year, Trump stated he wanted the US to take over the mineral-rich and strategically located autonomous territory of Denmark for reasons of international security.
  The American president also said he wanted to “take back” the Panama Canal, which the US agreed in 1977 to return to Panama and did officially in 1999. - SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST

米虫是一种喜欢在米粒里产卵的害虫，孵化后以米粒内部为主要食物，体长只有2-4毫米左右，很容易被肉眼所忽视。（示意图）
（吉隆坡15日讯）大米还没开封就已经藏有
米虫
？别担心，专家提醒，只需几个简单步骤，就能有效防止米虫上门。
根据网媒《Says》报道，米虫也名为“象鼻虫”（Rice weevil），是一种喜欢在米粒里产卵的害虫，孵化后以米粒内部为主要食物。
ADVERTISEMENT
这种昆虫体型较小，呈黑褐色，有时还会飞，它的体长只有2至4毫米左右，大家很容易忽视，进而导致它们过度繁殖。
更可怕的是，雌性米虫一生可以产下300多枚卵，每产一枚卵，它都会刺穿米粒，将卵塞入米粒，然后盖住洞口。
很多时候，大家会责怪自家厨房不干净，才会引起米虫滋生；但实际上，它们可能是从超市被带回来，它们的卵可能藏在包装好的大米里，回到家中，在炎热潮湿的环境中孵化。
这就是为什么，即使一个人的厨房像制药厂一样干净，他家的大米仍然可能被米虫侵蚀，而且不仅大米，它们还会靠近豆类、面粉、谷物，甚至是泡面。
即使一个人的厨房像制药厂一样干净，他家的大米仍然可能被米虫侵蚀。（示意图）
冷冻 密封存米 天然驱虫剂
如果想防止米虫滋生，可在购买大米后，将其短暂冷冻，或将其放入冰箱冷藏3至4天的时间，杀死可能隐藏的任何虫卵。
或者，也可以将大米存放在密封容器中，避免存放在通风容器或易撕裂的塑料容器中。
另一种方法则是使用天然驱虫剂，可将泰国柠檬叶、干辣椒、大蒜、或斑斓叶放入盛米容器中作为驱虫剂。
此外，使用白醋擦拭厨房和储物箱，会有助于去除异味和虫卵痕迹。
每户家庭也应该避免一次购买过多的大米，最好根据各自需求购买，以免大米在室温下存放太久。
不仅如此，在装入新米之前，用干净的干布擦拭米桶，不要将新米和旧米混合，因为若旧米中已经有米虫，那么问题就会“转移”到了新米上。
如果米里只有少量米虫，而且米看上去没有坏掉，是可以像往常一样在煮饭前过滤和清洗，而最简单的方法是先过筛，然后清洗2到3次，直到米水清澈为止。
不过，如果发现大米有异味、看起来腐烂了、或米虫太多，那么最好把整桶米扔掉，因为自己的健康远比一包米更加重要。
另一方面，切勿把“受污染”的大米扔进普通的厨房垃圾桶，要把它装进扎紧的塑料袋里，然后立即扔到屋外的垃圾桶。
“如果不小心处理，米虫很可能会再次出现，重新滋生在厨房内。
事后，最好也使用肥皂水或醋擦拭米桶和储藏区域，确保没有米虫或虫卵残留。

CAMERON HIGHLANDS: Suasana riuh di pusat jualan sayur-sayuran terkenal Kea Farm, di sini bertukar kecoh apabila sebuah kereta dipercayai hilang kawalan sebelum merempuh sekumpulan orang awam dalam kejadian yang tular dalam media sosial, hari ini.
  Dalam insiden kira-kira pukul 12 tengah hari itu, empat pelancong termasuk tiga kanak-kanak berusia tiga tahun hingga 10 tahun dilaporkan cedera selepas dirempuh kenderaan yang meluncur laju di kawasan sesak tersebut.
  Rakaman kamera litar tertutup (CCTV) berdurasi 33 saat yang tersebar dalam laman sosial Facebook, khususnya dalam Group Informasi Cameron Highlands, memaparkan detik cemas ketika kereta jenis Perodua Myvi terbabit merempuh pengunjung yang sedang membeli-belah di tepi jalan.
  Ketua Polis Daerah Cameron Highlands, Superintenden Azri Ramli ketika dihubungi mengesahkan kejadian dan memaklumkan kesemua mangsa  menerima rawatan di fasiliti kesihatan berhampiran sebelum dibenarkan pulang.

Senator Miguel Uribe remains hospitalized in intensive care. (AFP pic)
BOGOTA
:
A woman arrested Saturday in southern Colombia was suspected of being involved in the attempted murder of presidential candidate Miguel Uribe, police said.
Uribe, a 39-year-old conservative senator, was shot twice in the head and once in the leg while giving a speech in a park on June 7 in western Bogota.
The alleged shooter, a 15-year-old boy, and an accomplice who was accused of participating in the “logistics” of the attack had already been arrested.
On Saturday, a police source informed AFP of a woman – suspected of having links to the attack – who was arrested in the Amazon region of Caqueta.
“In the next few hours, they will transfer her to Bogota,” the police source said, without providing further details.
The other two detainees, heavily guarded in a prosecutor’s bunker, are accused of homicide and carrying weapons.
The minor, identified as the alleged gunman, pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday.
According to a report Saturday in Colombian magazine Semana, he said he was offered 20 million pesos (more than US$4,800) to kill the politician.
The newspaper El Tiempo also reported that one of the accused named a criminal who lives in Ecuador and controls a drug dealing area in Bogota as the alleged mastermind.
Uribe remained hospitalized in intensive care, though he showed some signs of improvement this past week, doctors said Wednesday.
President Gustavo Petro said the senator’s improving health “cannot be explained by science”.
“He should be dead… and what’s happening is that he’s recovering,” Petro said Saturday.
Uribe’s party, the opposition Democratic Center, temporarily suspended its campaign events for the 2026 presidential elections on Friday.
Uribe has been a strong critic of Petro, Colombia’s first left-wing president, who sought in vain to make peace with the country’s various remaining armed groups.

LONDON (AFP): A rare oil painting of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, which is believed to have been damaged by a Hindu nationalist activist, is to be auctioned in London in July.
  Gandhi, one of the most influential figures in India's history, led a non-violent movement against British rule and inspired similar resistance campaigns across the world.
  He is the subject of tens of thousands of artworks, books and films.
  But a 1931 painting by British-American artist Clare Leighton is believed to be the only oil portrait he sat for, according to the painter's family and Bonhams, where it will be auctioned online from July 7 to 15.
  "Not only is this a rare work by Clare Leighton, who is mainly known for her wood engravings, it is also thought to be the only oil painting of Mahatma Gandhi which he sat for," said Rhyanon Demery, Bonhams Head of Sale for Travel and Exploration.
  The painting is a "likely hidden treasure", Caspar Leighton, the artist's great-nephew, told AFP.
  Going under the hammer for the first time next month, the painting is estimated to sell for between £50,000 and £70,000 ($68,000 and $95,000).
  Clare Leighton met Gandhi in 1931, when he was in London for talks with the British government on India's political future.
  She was part of London's left-wing artistic circles and was introduced to Gandhi by her partner, journalist Henry Noel Brailsford.
  "I think there was clearly a bit of artistic intellectual courtship that went on," said Caspar, pointing out that his great-aunt and Gandhi shared a "sense of social justice".
  - Painting attacked - 
  The portrait, painted at a crucial time for India's independence struggle, "shows Gandhi at the height of his power", added Caspar.
  It was exhibited in London in November 1931, following which Gandhi's personal secretary, Mahadev Desai, wrote to Clare: "It was such a pleasure to have had you here for many mornings doing Mr Gandhi's portrait."
  "Many of my friends who saw it in the Albany Gallery said to me that it was a good likeness," reads a copy of the letter attached to the painting's backing board.
  The painting intimately captures Gandhi's likeness but it also bears reminders of his violent death.
  Gandhi was shot at point-blank range in 1948 by disgruntled Hindu nationalist activist Nathuram Godse, once closely associated with the right-wing paramilitary organisation RSS.
  Godse and some other Hindu nationalist figures accused Gandhi of betraying Hindus by agreeing to the partition of India and the creation of Muslim-majority Pakistan.
  According to Leighton's family, the painting was attacked with a knife by a "Hindu extremist" believed to be an RSS activist, in the early 1970s.
  Although there is no documentation of the attack, a label on the back of the painting confirms that it was restored in the United States in 1974.
  Under UV light, Demery pointed out the shadow of a deep gash running across Gandhi's face where the now-restored painting was damaged.
  "It feels very deliberate," she said.
  - 'Real home' - 
  The repairs "add to the value of the picture in a sense... to its place in history, that Gandhi was again attacked figuratively many decades after his death", said Caspar.
  The only other recorded public display of the painting was in 1978 at a Boston Public Library exhibition of Clare Leighton's work.
  After Clare's death, the artwork passed down to Caspar's father and then to him.
  "There's my family's story but the story in this portrait is so much greater," he said.
  "It's a story for millions of people across the world," he added.
  "I think it'd be great if it got seen by more people. Maybe it should go back to India -- maybe that's its real home."
  Unlike countless depictions of the man known in India as the "father of the nation" -- in stamps, busts, paraphernalia and recreated artwork -- "this is actually from the time", said Caspar. - AFP

KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 — Crocodile cracking, a form of road surface damage, was detected at the scene of the accident that claimed the life of a Singaporean cyclist in Kulai, Johor, yesterday, said Works Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi.
  He said the damage to state road J165 was likely due to frequent use by heavy vehicles, particularly lorries from a nearby quarry area.
  Nanta said that although grading work to upgrade the road shoulder was carried out earlier this year, the excessive load caused the damage to recur.
  “Although the road falls under the jurisdiction of the State Government, the Works Ministry (KKR) is concerned about its condition, which poses a risk to road users, including motorcyclists and cyclists,” he said in a statement today.
  A male Singaporean cyclist was killed after he was believed to have fallen and subsequently hit by a trailer along Jalan Gunung Pulai, Kulai, at about 9.45 am yesterday.
  Nanta said that as an immediate measure, he had contacted the state authorities to ensure that pavement rehabilitation works, including re-levelling of road shoulders in the affected areas, were implemented immediately, with comprehensive repairs to follow once the necessary allocation was approved.
  He urged all parties involved in road maintenance, along with road users and local communities, to work together to ensure road conditions remain safe, comfortable and of good quality to help reduce road accidents.
  Nanta also advised all cyclists, particularly those using public roads, to always prioritise safety and avoid routes frequently used by heavy vehicles.
  “Choose a suitable and safe time, such as early mornings on weekends, and always ensure the use of safety equipment, including helmets and reflective lights.
  “Adhere to traffic regulations, avoid using mobile phones while cycling and make sure your bicycle is in good condition,” he said.
  Nanta extended his heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the family of the victim involved in the incident. — Bernama

KUALA LUMPUR: The stretch of road where a Singaporean cyclist crashed and died in Kulai, Johor, showed a form of damage known as "crocodile cracking", says Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi.
  Crocodile cracking is where the damaged road has interconnected cracks resembling crocodile skin, typically caused by repeated over-loading.
  The Works Minister said the damage to state road J165 was likely due to frequent use by heavy vehicles.
  Nanta said that although work to upgrade the road shoulder was carried out earlier this year, damage recurred due to heavy vehicles.
  "Although the road falls under the jurisdiction of the state government, the Works Ministry is concerned about the condition as it poses a risk to road users," he said in a statement on Sunday (June 15).
  A male Singaporean cyclist was killed after he fell and was hit by a trailer on Jalan Gunung Pulai, Kulai, at about 9.45am on Sunday.
  Nanta said he had contacted state authorities to ensure the road is resurfaced immediately, with comprehensive repairs to follow once the necessary allocation is approved.
  Nanta also advised cyclists, particularly those using public roads, to prioritise safety and avoid routes frequently used by heavy vehicles.

（沙亚南15日讯）有钱开
豪车
，没钱缴路税
保险
！
雪州陆路交通局（JPJ）于上周四（12日）在加影蕉赖大道一带展开日常取缔行动时，揪出两辆未更新路税与保险的豪华轿车，即一辆福特野马（Ford Mustang）与一辆宝马X5，而两名司机竟辩称“
经济拮据
”为由试图开脱，引起关注！
ADVERTISEMENT
该行动于当天下午2时展开，持续至晚上11时，被截查的两辆豪车分别在不同地点被发现违规。
对此，雪州陆路交通局局长阿兹林今日发文告指出，当局检查后发现，两辆车皆无有效的机动车执照（LKM）及未投保任何汽车保险，属于违法行为。
“被截查的福特野马司机是一名年约30岁的本地男子，因拖欠罚单且已被列入黑名单，导致无法更新路税。
“另一辆宝马X5的司机，则是一名40多岁的男子，其轿车路税早已逾期超过1年，也没有任何保险记录。”
阿兹林特指出，两名涉事司机皆声称因经济拮据，才未能更新路税与保险，尽管他们所驾驶的车辆市值高达数十万令吉。
“所有涉案车辆已被充公，并带往沙亚南陆路交通局作进一步处理。”
他强调，陆路交通局不会对任何违例者妥协，包括那些违法上路的豪车车主。
他还补充，驾豪车并不代表可以凌驾于法律之上。
“所有道路使用者都必须遵守相同的交通规则，包括持有有效的路税与保险。
“雪州陆路交通局将持续监督道路情况，并重视来自民众的每一项投诉。”

LUMUT: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim reiterated the government’s commitment to fight corruption and power abuse, assuring that no one, regardless of their political affiliation or past leadership status, will be spared.
  He said under his leadership, the government would not obstruct any investigation or arrest by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), as long as the individuals involved are genuinely guilty of wrongdoing.
  Anwar stated he did not care if the arrests are made daily and that he would not interfere.
  "Arrest whoever you want, whether they are from the Unity Government, the opposition, or those retired.
  "As long as they really stole, arrest them," he said during his speech at the closing ceremony of the Madani Rakyat event at the Lumut Waterfront on Sunday (June 15).
  Citing examples, Anwar said cases involving former ministers linked to financial scandals worth billions of ringgit, some of whom are still trying to gain public sympathy by appealing to their age and status.
  "There are former ministers who say, 'pity us, we are old'. I do sympathise, but if you stole public funds, you must return it," he added.
  Anwar added that the government would continue to uphold proper governance and remain committed to principles of transparency without compromise.
  He said this included ending the culture of awarding projects without open tenders.
  "I want to recover whatever was stolen from the country, and I hope everyone will cooperate so we can keep doing our work properly," he said.
  Anwar also stressed that he holds no personal grudges against those who wronged him in the past, but matters involving national wealth are a different story.
  "You used to insult me, jail me, beat me, now I am the Prime Minister and I have forgiven all of that.
  "But if you stole the people’s money, you are obligated to return it," he said.

LABUAN, June 15 (Bernama) -- Labuan is positioning itself as a niche destination for South Korean travellers following a four-day familiarisation trip by senior executives from seven major travel agencies in South Korea.
  Held from June 12 to 15, the visit aimed to showcase Labuan’s unique tourism offerings, including golf, diving and island escapes, to develop tailored tour packages for the Korean market.
  The initiative was jointly organised by Tourism Malaysia’s Seoul and Sabah offices, the Labuan Tourism Information Centre, the Department of Tourism, Culture and Arts under Labuan Corporation (LC), As well as the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (MOTAC), with support from local operators and hoteliers.
  During the visit, the delegation explored key attractions such as renowned shipwreck and coral reef dive sites, the 18-hole Labuan International Golf Club and island destinations like Pulau Rusukan Besar.
  They also toured leading accommodations including Tiara Labuan Hotel, Palm Beach Resort and Spa, AZ Hotel and Serviced Apartment, Beta Serviced Apartment and eco-tourism site Desa Tunas Hijau.
  The Labuan Tourism Information Centre said the visit marked a strategic effort to tap into the growing demand among South Korean tourists for nature-based and experiential travel, with Labuan offering a peaceful, less-discovered alternative.
  “What we offer is tranquillity, nature and niche experiences, from world-class diving and golf to quiet, pristine islands, which appeal to Korean travellers seeking destinations beyond the mainstream,” it said.
  It added that connectivity via Kota Kinabalu and potential regional partnerships could help position Labuan as a preferred tropical getaway in the Borneo region.
  South Korean travel representatives were optimistic about Labuan’s potential, citing a growing interest in tropical destinations that combine relaxation and adventure.
  The visit is expected to lead to new promotional content, tour packages and digital campaigns targeting the Korean market, boosting Labuan’s visibility in Northeast Asia.

斯里歌德中学是甲州唯一的体育学校。（陈淑婷摄）
（马六甲15日讯）
斯里歌德中学
是甲州唯一的体育学校，唯体育
设施失修
，跑道破烂，场内没有灯光操作，影响学生们的日常训练。
怡力区州议员林朝雁说，斯里歌德中学是全甲唯一的体育学校，属于教育部管辖，该校曾向她反映体育场没有灯光，影响学生在晚上展开训练，因此在去年11月向教育部提出拨款，增设太阳能照明设备。

林朝雁：已嘱咐校方报价
林朝雁说，教育部副部长黄家和在得悉该校的情况后，已嘱咐校方提呈报价，以便做出安排。
她说，斯里歌德中学是甲州体育新苗的摇篮，许多有潜能的学生都在这里进行系统性的专业培训，诞生了不少州手。
她也希望青体部关注，共同协助及推动学校的设施发展，为甲州及国家栽培更多体育代表。
“去年的马六甲首长杯运动会，怡力选区在甲州28州选区中脱颖而出，成为全场总冠军，斯里歌德中学的选手们在这场赛会中居功不少。”
林朝雁说，除了一般培训，该校学生也有到国外比赛，以累积经验，提升表现。
“学生们需接受持续性的培训，因此学校的体育设施需获得关注，甲州需要体育人才，就须确保学生们获得完善的培训。”
该校的体育设施，除了供校内学生使用，也经常有其他学校租借为运动会场地。
林朝雁也希望政府多关注运动员的出路，因为许多选手在学校毕业后，因没有更好的出路，例如受聘担任教练培训新秀，而被迫离开体育界，转而到其他行业发展。
“我将继续跟进学校的进展，以便损坏的设施顺利获得改善。”

  The “Great East Japan Earthquake” happened on March 11, 2011. I was supposed to go on my maiden trip to Tokyo the following week. Naturally, the trip was cancelled namely for safety reasons.
  The disaster left a deep impression on me not only because of devastating images and videos shared on the news, but also because March 11 is my father’s birthday. That day, I decided to learn more about Sendai, the nearest major city to the earthquake epicentre.
  Sendai is the capital of Miyagi Prefecture and the largest city in the Tohoku region. It is nicknamed the “City of Trees” due to the many Japanese zelkova trees lining its main thoroughfares.
  It only takes 90 minutes to get to Sendai from Tokyo via shinkansen or high-speed train.
  The Earthquake Heritage Arahama Elementary School where 320 people were trapped on the roof during the 2011 tsunami.
  Every year on March 11, in remembrance of the quake and to honur the victims, a bell rings throughout the main shopping streets in Sendai to signal the start of a silent tribute at precisely 2.46pm. This was the exact time the earthquake took place back in 2011.
  A special altar is also set up for folks to place their offerings and prayers.
  I visited the city on the 14th anniversary of the incident recently, and joined the memorial ceremony. A moment of silence was observed, followed by a special music performance.
  It was a heartfelt gathering where people of all ages, from preschoolers to the elderly, shared a collective moment of reflection.
  Yuzuru Hanyu, Sendai’s tourism ambassador, is a two-time Olympic champion figure skater and one of the many local residents affected by the disaster. He continues to be a strong advocate for disaster awareness and reconstruction efforts to this day.
  In fact, I travelled to Sendai not just for the memorial but also to attend his show called Notte Stellata. This is an annual ensemble ice performance held in remembrance of the tragedy. It took place at the Sekisui Heim Super Arena, which served as the largest temporary morgue in Miyagi during the disaster.
  Watching the show at this specific venue with locals was not just a solemn reminder of what was lost, but of what the future holds.
  I also visited the Earthquake Heritage Arahama Elementary School to learn more about the disaster. Situated 700m from the coast, the tsunami inundated the school up to the second floor, trapping 320 individuals including students, teachers, and local residents on the roof.
  Miraculously, everyone survived.
  The entrance of the Osaki Hachimangu shrine, whose deity is revered as the city’s guardian and protector.
  Because of this moving story, the school has been preserved as much as possible in its damaged state to help future generations understand the incredible force of a tsunami.
  I couldn’t help but notice how barren the surrounding land had become. I was told that the Arahama neighbourhood was once home to 800 households, but today, the only building left standing is the school. Many former residents have relocated inland as the area is now designated a high-risk zone for future disasters.
  At Arai Station, just 15 minutes from central Sendai, I visited the 3/11 Memorial Community Centre, established in 2016 to preserve and share the experiences and lessons of the disaster. It features a community space with a 3D topographic map, slides, and books detailing the impact on Sendai’s eastern coastal areas.
  Exhibits also showcased the destruction caused by the tsunami, ongoing restoration efforts, and scenes from affected communities.
  The writer standing between posters of Yuzuru Hanyu, Sendai’s two-time Olympic champion in figure skating.
  By the way, Sendai is best explored by taking the Loople Sendai, a fixed-fare sightseeing bus that stops at 14 notable spots around the city, with a one-day pass costing just ¥630 (RM18.50).
  With the pass, I was able to visit numerous landmarks: The Zuihoden Mausoleum, the final resting place of the samurai Date Masamune, who founded Sendai; Sendai Castle, once the stronghold of the Date clan; Osaki Hachimangu Shrine, a designated national treasure whose enshrined deity is revered as the city’s guardian and protector; and the Sendai International Centre, where I snapped a photo with the commemorative panel display honouring Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu.
  Just a short walk from the centre is Goshikinuma Pond, considered the birthplace of figure skating in Japan. (Fun fact: Sendai has produced Japan’s only two Olympic gold medallists in figure skating so far.)
  Of course, I couldn’t leave without visiting the Ice Rink Sendai, the training ground of the champions.
  As I left Sendai, I carried with me not just memories of an inspiring ice show and visits to meaningful landmarks, but a deepened respect for the city’s resilience and spirit. The legacy of 3.11 lives on.

私房好菜 | 慢工蒸鱼传匠心 赖冠霖守护最传统香气
报道：伍思薇摄影：黄冰冰
鱼在蒸煮过程中，充分吸收姜蓉的香气与味道，搭配其他食材一起蒸煮，更是提升整道菜的口感与层次感，汤汁溢香。
在追求快速与效率的时代，来自士拉央峇鲁“
鱼王馆
”的女东主赖冠霖选择慢工出细活，坚持不加防腐剂、不用代工，只为保留一锅
蒸鱼
最本真的香气。
如今，她把这份手艺与精神交给接棒的女儿，希望一道道的美味佳肴，也能承载一代代的匠心与爱。
ADVERTISEMENT
赖冠霖接受本报专访时，分享了她在制作蒸鱼头、鱼肚及肉饼等料理方面的心得，同时也展现了她对食材讲究，以及对传统口味的坚持。
赖冠霖（右）始终坚持亲自制作，慢慢研发属于自己的味道，如今更是把这份手艺与精神交给女儿陈彦霓接棒。
蒸鱼头2关键：新鲜与清洗
赖冠霖强调，蒸鱼头最重要的两个关键是“新鲜”和“清洗干净”。尤其是本地松鱼，本身就带有一些天然的泥味，若处理不当，会加重腥味，影响整体风味。
因此，她建议在清洗鱼头时，除了彻底去除内脏与血水外，还可使用食盐搓洗鱼身和鱼腔内外，再冲洗干净，有助于去腥提鲜。
她表示，在挑选新鲜鱼头时，可以从几个细节判断，包括鱼肉应有弹性，用手轻轻按压不会软塌；鱼眼明亮、不浑浊且微微凸起；鱼身应光滑不黏手，这些都是新鲜鱼的标志。
她说，她所选用的松鱼是来自活水养殖场的，这种水源不断流动，可有效减少鱼体的泥味，相较之下，静止死水养殖的鱼更易残留泥臭味。
顾客启发创意 蒸煮Q弹风味鱼肚
赖冠霖透露，“
酱蒸松鱼肚肠
”这道菜的由来，最初是受到顾客启发的。当时，有顾客问她，既然店内有售卖蒸松鱼头，为何不做鱼肚？于是她向供应商询问，并尝试自行处理生鱼肚。
鱼肚经过蒸熟、冷藏及再次蒸煮的过程后，变得口感Q弹，风味十足。
她表示，她将鱼肚清洗干净后以食盐搓洗，再以家常方式来蒸煮，不到半小时便可熟成，口感Q弹，风味十足。
她指出，蒸鱼肚的关键也在于处理干净。蒸熟后的鱼肚带有一丝微咸的自然风味，其口感与鱿鱼有些相似，但比鱿鱼更有弹性，且不会因蒸久而变柴。
她说，鱼肚是源自大型的鱼体内，也是大家所熟知、经过处理后的“鱼鳔”，在市场上并不常见，因此她的鱼肚时常供不应求。
“尤其一条鱼只取出一小部分鱼肚，处理后重量大幅减少，原本一公斤重的鱼肚，经过蒸熟后可能只剩600克的重量，可谓物以稀为贵。”
吊片肉饼
扎实滑嫩
本身是客家人的赖冠霖透露，客家人非常喜欢使用吊片（晒干后的鱿鱼）来进行烹饪，她也将儿时记忆中的吊片与肉饼融合起来，打造出带有浓郁咸香味的怀旧风味。
肉饼的口感软嫩，而且每一口肉饼都带出吊片的浓郁香气，是一道简单又美味的家常菜肴。
她说，肉饼是一道很简单的家常菜，只需购买合适的肉碎，加入鸡蛋、薯粉和调味料搅拌均因，即可入蒸锅。
她表示，在食材选择上她仍坚持质量。制作肉饼时，她选用的是猪腿肉，并额外添加猪油以提升口感，使肉饼更加弹牙滑嫩。
“经过我几番尝试，猪腿肉及猪油的最好比例为8：2，制作出来的肉饼口感最佳。”
她指出，一般市场贩售的绞肉大多使用其他部位，缺少弹性；而猪腿肉则因肌肉结构紧致，适合制作口感扎实的肉饼。
丈夫病逝后接棒
守住原味开创新菜色
赖冠霖透露，其丈夫在16年前以蒸鱼头起家，当时从租档口开始做起，慢慢地创办了“鱼王馆”。后来因丈夫病重离世，由她接手经营，她不仅延续原有招牌菜，还陆续开发了更多家常菜色。
她坦言，部分新菜式如鱼肚与肉饼，是根据顾客反馈不断调整、尝试得出的成果。她一方面坚持选用优质食材，一方面保留传统做法，同时也愿意依据顾客口味进行调整，例如有顾客偏爱酱蒸、原味或娘惹风味的鱼肚，她也乐意配合。
女儿接手管理工作
她表示，她的女儿在大学毕业后也愿意接手餐馆的管理工作。作为母亲，她逐渐放手，让女儿亲自尝试与学习。如今，餐馆里的肉饼和所有自制酱料，几乎都由女儿亲手烹制。
“你看我做和自己下手去做，是完全不一样的。只有亲自操作之后，才会变得更顺手，也更容易理解每一个步骤该怎么做、该注意什么。光是看，是记不住的；做过一遍，才会真正记得住。”
坚持手工制作食材酱料
她说，在食材和酱料方面，她始终坚持传统手工制作，不愿意使用市面上现成、方便的替代品。
“虽然现在市场上有很多省时的做法，但我还是尽量不用那些东西。我宁愿花多点时间，慢慢去研发属于自己的味道。虽然做生意是要赚钱的，但如果我自己都过不了那道心坎，我就没办法安心卖出去。”
她说，曾有人建议她找代工厂合作，把酱料交由外厂生产，以便节省人力和时间，但她坚持全部酱料都要自己在店里亲手熬煮。
她表示，店内售卖的一系列酱料，和他们在餐馆里烹煮时用的是一样的味道。只是他们煮好酱料后，会自己进行包装处理，让它可保存得更久。

(Reuters) -Forward Mathys Tel has signed for Tottenham Hotspur on a permanent deal after a four-month loan spell at the Premier League team from Bayern Munich, both clubs said on Sunday.
  The France Under-21 international has signed a contract at Tottenham until 2031, with media reports saying the deal was worth around 30 million pounds ($41 million).
  "Mathys Tel came to FC Bayern as a very young player and mastered his first steps at the top level of European football here," Bayern's head of sport Max Eberl said in a statement. 
  "He was a popular figure in the squad, who always gave his all for the club and the team. The move to Tottenham has turned out to be the right one for his development."
  Tel, 20, joined Bayern from Stade Rennes in 2022 on a four-year deal and extended his contract to 2029 in March last year, scoring 16 goals in 83 appearances for the German club, but struggling to find a place in the starting side.
  He joined Tottenham on loan in February, making 20 appearances, and was part of the squad which earned the North London club their first major trophy in 17 years with a 1-0 victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final.
  Tel becomes the first signing under new coach Thomas Frank, who was appointed on Thursday to replace the sacked Ange Postecoglou.

LONDON, June 15 — Forward Mathys Tel has signed for Tottenham Hotspur on a permanent deal after a four-month loan spell at the Premier League team from Bayern Munich, both clubs said today.
  The France Under-21 international has signed a contract at Tottenham until 2031, with media reports saying the deal was worth around £30 million (RM174 million).
  “Mathys Tel came to FC Bayern as a very young player and mastered his first steps at the top level of European football here,” Bayern’s head of sport Max Eberl said in a statement.

停车格在尺寸大小不一，甚至出现“上宽下窄”的情况下，造成泊车后无法开门下车等问题，更是引争吵等不愉快事情的发生。
（士拉央15日讯）铺路后重新画上的
停车格
尺寸
不合规格，士拉央再也商业区的上百个停车位出现上宽下窄的情况，以致停车面对困难或停进去后很难下车，更因而造成车主之间发生争执。
无论如何，士拉央市议员余深恩在接获投诉后，亲自前往了解情况包括测量停车格尺寸，在确定停车格尺寸确实不合规格后，也立即向市议会及有关单位作出反映，要求承包商修改及重画停车格。
ADVERTISEMENT
如今，随着修改停车格的工作已完成后，该区的停车位现已全部恢复合规格的尺寸，不再发生因停车问题出现的争吵及投诉。
余深恩（右）在接获投诉后，特别联同承包商前往巡视以了解问题。（余深恩提供）
余深恩（右）亲自测量停车格的尺寸。（余深恩提供）
余深恩：当中有80%不符合规格
余深恩对《大都会》社区报指出，这次的重铺道路及重画停车格工作，是雪州水务管理公司（Air Selangor）在当地展开的水管工程的善后工作，也是由该公司负责承担及委任承包商，但重画的停车格却面对尺寸问题。
他说，这次涉及重画的停车格大约有500个，分布在士拉央再也商业区的1路及17路周围一带；经过测量及检查发现，当中有80%是不符合规格，即停车格的前端与后端的尺寸相差了6寸至1呎之间。
他透露，他本身接到不少相关投诉，同时也有者直接在社交媒体上投诉，更有当地商家是亲自测量停车格的尺寸，以证明车位是不符合规格。
士拉央再也商业区500余个停车格内，有其中80%的尺寸是不符合规格。
他也说，这些停车格因尺寸问题，导致车辆面对“能进不能出”的窘境，甚至因为车位小了，容易与旁边车辆有碰撞，因而造成不愉快及争执发生。
“因为位子狭窄，车进去后可能会开不到门、出不开，或者当你开车门时，可能会碰到或刮花停在隔壁的车辆，双方会互相指责对方‘吃了’自己的位子，所以会造成吵架。”
余深恩说，他在发现问题后也立即向市议会作出反映，并由负责有关工程的雪州水务管理公司指示承包商作出修改。
他说，经过修改后，所有涉及的车位已恢复合规格的尺寸，即10×16公尺，有着足够的空间停车及开门下车，因停车位导致的不愉快事情也不再发生。
经过投诉与反映后，所有涉及的停车格已修改为合规格的尺寸。
地面上明显可见修改后留下的痕迹，与原本的停车格的尺寸不符。

西华拉治认为，陈康乐（右）与蒂娜和大马羽总如继续拖延续约问题，恐将影响她们的表现和专注力。（法新社照片）
（吉隆坡15日讯）大马羽球名宿兼前
大马羽总
高绩效总监拿督
西华拉治
警告，大马头号女双“
乐蒂组合
”
陈康乐与蒂娜
和大马羽总之间僵持的
合约
问题，恐将影响她们的竞技状态与专注力。
自乐蒂组合和羽总的合约僵局消息传出以来，至今已过了两个月，但至今仍未有任何明确进展。这支世界排名升上职业生涯新高第3位的大马国家羽球队绝对主力女双，究竟会继续留在国家队体制内，还是选择转为自由人，目前仍未明朗。
ADVERTISEMENT
外来因素会影响球员专注力
西华拉治直言，这种长期的不确定状态绝非良好现象，甚至可能对球员的表现和专注力造成负面影响：“我不知道到底发生了什么，也不明白为什么会拖这么久，但作为一位前国手，我只想对康乐和蒂娜说‘尽快解决这件事’，这才是对她们最好的。”
“运动员应该只专注在训练与比赛上，这种不必要的外界因素，只会分散她们的注意力，也可能影响场上的表现。”
西华拉治过去曾担任羽总高绩效总监，他也呼吁乐蒂组合在当前的世界巡回赛空档期间好好把握机会，一方面彻底解决合约问题，另一方面也提升两人的比赛细节。
过去一个月的4站世界巡回赛，前法国羽球公开赛冠军乐蒂组合的表现和状态出色，在泰国羽球超级500赛夺得冠军，随后打进大马羽球级500赛4强、新加坡羽球超级750赛8强，并在印尼羽球超级1000获得亚军。
称罗斯曼执教很适合乐蒂
西华拉治强调：“她们的表现确实持续进步，我认为其中一大关键就是现任国羽女双主教练罗斯曼，这也是她们自己指定要的教练。”
“所以，为什么不趁这个时机让罗斯曼继续带她们往更高水平迈进？不要再让这份合约的事情干扰她们了。”
目前看来，主动权似乎已回到乐蒂组合手上，因羽总尚未设下任何正式的谈判期限。
乐蒂已长达半年没正式合约
就在刚过去的周五，新上任的大马羽总会长东姑赛夫鲁再次表态，希望能够留住这对顶级女双，尽管她们和羽总已没有正式合约长达6个月之久。
根据《Scoop》早前报道，乐蒂组合寻求重新谈判合约内容，要求的待遇是比照羽总顶级球员标准，年薪预估约为200万令吉。
尽管乐蒂组合和羽总的合约早在2024年12月届满，也没有正式签署新合约，她们目前仍在大马羽球学院继续训练，搭乘商务舱出征比赛，也照常领取薪资。

KETIKA orang tertinggi sindiket Ruska Roma berkata kepada Eve Maccaro ‘berlawanlah seperti perempuan’, saya merasakan dia sedang memberi petunjuk bagaimana saya harus memahami dan melihat Ballerina sebagai sebuah filem. Dia kemudian menambah, ‘cabar setiap syarat dan peraturan’. Maka bermulalah perjalanan kewiraan, atau lebih tepat, perjalanan srikandi Eve untuk memusnahkan siapa sahaja yang terlibat dalam pembunuhan bapanya. 
  Walaupun adegan bapa dan anak di awal filem tidak begitu mengesankan, tapi saya setuju ia penting menunjukkan bagaimana seorang gadis manis yang cuma mahu menari ballet akhirnya membuat keputusan menjadi pembunuh. 
  Saya sebenarnya berharap, Ballerina dapat sedikit menjelaskan bagaimana sebuah tarian yang dianggap begitu perempuan, ayu, anggun, penuh emosi (memetik konsep ballet d’action, Jean-Georges Noverre)  boleh menjadi latihan sebuah gerakan para pembunuh. Juga memberi jawapan mengapa bapa kepada Eve bersungguh mengajarnya tarian ballet bukan sekadar suka-suka, tapi sebuah cara menangani musuh. 
  Eve dilakonkan sudah semestinya oleh wanita jelita, Ana de Armas yang masih nampak seperti remaja belasan walau usianya sudah mencecah 37 tahun. Ana memerankan Eve, di mana rambutnya tidak beralih sedikitpun walau selepas melalui pertarungan maha dahsyat. Begitu juga solekannya. Cuma kadang-kadang sahaja lebam dan berdarah tanpa mengganggu struktur wajah.
  Beberapa tahun berlalu, Eve seperti mengulang cerita dalam Genesis yang dikeluarkan dari Taman Edan kerana melanggar perintah. Dia ‘berlawan seperti perempuan’ dengan ‘melawan peraturan’ Ruska Roma demi menjatuhkan Chancellor dan seluruh sekutunya. 
  Eve menjadi bintang utama filem ini namun perjalanan heroiknya banyak dibantu watak penting, para lelaki yang mengagumi api di matanya, bukan mahukan ghairah dan persona tubuh seorang perempuan seperti filem Hollywood lain. Sepanjang perjalanan, dia bertemu Charon, Pine dan semestinya Frank walau kedai senjatanya separa musnah.
  Bercerita tentang aksi, Ballerina nampaknya tidak menunjukkan banyak perbezaan pertarungan lelaki dan perempuan. Cuma saya merasakan, ada beberapa babak pertarungan sedikit humor dan lebih menarik ditonton berbanding filem terakhir John Wick – terutama ketika Eve sudah menjejakkan kaki ke pekan penuh salji. 
  Filem ini juga menjadi lebih seronok untuk ditengok ketika memasuki bahagian kedua. Seperti permainan video rentaknya laju, pergerakan kameranya juga berjaya merakam aksi dengan cermat tanpa membuatkan kita berpusing-pusing mahu muntah atau berasa lelah.
  Kehadiran John Wick sudah semestinya menjadi sebab besar mengapa banyak orang mahu menonton filem ini. Penulisnya, Shey Hatten nampaknya berhati-hati dalam memposisikan tokoh itu kerana enggan dia menenggelamkan Eve dan seluruh premis filem ini. Nampaknya kehadiran John Wick seimbang, tidak bersifat menenggelamkan namun karakternya masih dilihat signifikan. 
  Walau bagaimanapun, kembali kepada ayat ‘berlawan seperti perempuan’, sejujurnya saya masih tidak menemui jawapan solid walaupun selepas filem ini tamat. Saya fikir, ada yang kurang dari filem ini terutama eksplorasi emosi dan perasaan seorang perempuan membuatkan agak sukar untuk saya memahami dan mengingati Eve selepas filem tamat.
  Mungkinkah juga Ballerina mahu menunjukkan bahawa di dunia yang serba laju ini, tidak ada beza antara lelaki dan perempuan. Masing-masing merana, tersiksa dan tidak boleh mengharapkan sesiapa lagi melainkan kudratnya sendiri.

Seruan agar manusia membaca telah menjadi ayat sulung al-Quran melalui perkataan iqra yang bermaksud ‘bacalah’. Ia memberikan satu interpretasi jelas bahawa amalan membaca adalah kunci kepada gerbang ilmu yang bermanfaat kepada proses lain dalam kehidupan termasuklah penulisan. Amat mustahil bagi seorang penulis untuk menghasilkan karya hebat dan berimpak tanpa membaca hasil-hasil karya terdahulu sama ada dalam genre kreatif atau deskriptif. Penulis juga perlu mempunyai pengetahuan luas dalam pelbagai bidang dan isu, yang mana ia hanya boleh diperoleh melalui membaca selain pengalaman sendiri.

他特别感谢早前曾响应捐肝呼吁、愿意出手相助的近20位亲友，并表示自己也是昨晚才一一回覆他们的讯息以表感谢，言语中尽是感激与不舍。
直至下午约1时30分，追思仪式结束后，艾威亲自捧着太太的遗照，神情哀戚地陪同灵柩步出灵堂，送爱妻最后一程。灵柩随即移送至和合石火葬场进行火化。
灵堂布置简约庄重，Lisa的遗照悬于正中央，摆放着心形花圈，挽词写道：“我的亲亲，好好休息”，落款“猪头炳威威”充满深情。（取自明报）

（吉隆坡15日马新社讯）外交部长拿督斯里莫哈末哈山指出，他近期将联系伊朗外交部长阿拉格齐，以要求伊朗不要关闭霍尔木兹海峡这条重要的石油与液化天然气（LNG）出口通道。
  他说，若关闭该海峡，将扰乱中东地区的石油贸易通道，继而引发全球石油供应短缺，并推高国际市场价格。
  “有传言称伊朗可能会关闭霍尔木兹海峡的供应通道，该海峡是伊朗与阿曼边境的入口，此举可能严重冲击全球石油供应链。
  “这将为全球带来巨大麻烦，因为许多原油都来自该区域，尤其是伊朗和卡塔尔。我会尝试今晚或明天联络伊朗外交部长。”
  他今日为巫统蕉赖区部及臂膀代表大会开幕后，在记者会上这么说。
  莫哈末哈山提到，大马理解伊朗的立场及当前紧张局势，但该国仍须对国际社会及全球贸易负起责任。
  全球市场正密切关注霍尔木兹海峡的局势，担心以色列与伊朗冲突不断升级可能影响该狭窄航道的航运。
  根据阿纳多卢通讯社，全球约三分之一的石油贸易，即每日约1700万至2000万桶原油和凝析油都经过霍尔木兹海峡运输。
  此外，莫哈末哈山提到，外交部已发出声明，要求在伊朗、伊拉克及约旦的大马公民联络当地的马来西亚大使馆。
  他说，所有在大使馆登记的大马公民都已成功联系上，并获当局发出适当指示，包括在必要时撤离到更安全地方。
  至于原定近期在纽约举行及讨论以色列及巴勒斯坦两国方案的联合国会议，他说，据知该会议已被推迟。
  另一方面，首相拿督斯里安华强调，我国捍卫每个国家的主权，包括最近遭到以色列攻击的伊朗。
  他在红土坎出席活动时说，作为一个主权国家，马来西亚将为伊朗发声，同时支持伊朗捍卫国家尊严而进行的反击。
  他说，尽管伊朗长期遭受经济制裁，但该国依然展现出强大的韧性，自主发展多项领域，包括军事能力。
  “伊朗在研发，训练孩子们学习人工智能，就算（许多国家）拒绝合作，但它能够学习。事实上，伊朗的反弹道导弹也能打到特拉维夫进行报复。”
  安华也批评许多欧洲国家不赞同伊朗报复反击以色列，并指这些国家存在双重标准。

SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN): Singaporean students bound for Harvard University are still pressing ahead with their plans despite uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s ban on foreign students, even as some still do not have their visas.
  Welly Tantono, the president of its Singapore alumni club, told The Straits Times on June 14 that as far as she is aware, none of the prospective Singaporean students have relinquished their offers.
  The Harvard Club of Singapore on June 14 organised a pre-departure meeting for the Republic’s Harvard hopefuls, which ST understands was attended by more than 10 matriculating undergraduates and postgraduates.
  Among them, about half have yet to obtain their visas, said a Harvard Club Board member, who declined to be named.
  Some existing visa appointments at the local US embassy have also been cancelled, and new appointments are difficult to make, he added.
  A total of 22 people had indicated on the club’s website that they would attend the annual event, which was held at Monk’s Brew Club in Katong.
  Tantono said the event had hoped to “offer comfort” to matriculating students.
  Typically a celebratory affair, it took on a different tenor this year with the theme Navigating Your Next Steps Amid Uncertainty, as anxious attendees sought advice and assurance.
  According to the club’s website, immigration lawyers were present to address students’ concerns about student visas, immigration issues and legal documentation.
  Current Harvard students and alumni were also invited to offer guidance to new students.
  Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan had said on June 7 that Singapore’s embassy in Washington has been seeking clarification from the US State Department and Department of Homeland Security on whether there would be a delay in visa processing for Singaporean students hoping to study in the US.
  He added that the Government is trying to find solutions to deal with the worst-case scenario where students are not able to physically study in Boston.
  Harvard’s fall semester is due to start in late August, with first-year students arriving a week early for placement tests and adjustment to campus life.
  Tantono said that amid the uncertainty, Harvard University has been up to date in its communications with international students, who understandably may have many concerns.
  The students have also been in contact with the Harvard International Office, she added.
  Trump has made recent moves to re-work the landscape of American higher education – claiming that private schools have tolerated campus anti-Semitism, while fostering anti-American and “radical left” ideologies.
  In April, the Trump Administration froze close to US$3 billion (S$3.8 billion) of Harvard’s federal research funding.
  A month later, the school’s right to host and enrol foreign students and scholars was terminated – a move that was later halted by a US District Judge.
  Trump’s June 4 directive to bar foreign nationals seeking to study the US from entering the country was also blocked temporarily by the judge, who on June 5, also extended May’s hold by about two weeks.
  The new temporary block made in June will also last for two weeks.
  The effects of the president’s siege have been felt across the university, where close to 6,800 international students make up about a third of the student populace. - The Straits Times/Asia News Network

JOHOR BARU: Malaysian authorities have launched an investigation into a Facebook group that allegedly encourages sexual comments on content involving children.
  Deputy Communications Minister Teo Nie Ching said the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) has contacted Meta about the matter.
  “This particular Facebook group has since been closed, and following that, MCMC, together with the police, are working together to take further action,” she added.
  Teo said this when he met during the Southern University College and Popular Bookstore literary charity sale and cultural performances held at Mid Valley Southkey here on Sunday (June 15).
  She, however, declined to comment further on the issue as it was now being investigated by both MCMC and the police.
  Teo said that throughout 2024, MCMC and the police have taken action against child sexual predators during a special operation held in several states.
  “Last year, through a joint effort between MCMC and the police, they arrested 13 individuals and took down over 40,000 child pornography content found online.
  “MCMC will always continue to work closely with the police to take appropriate action against those found to be involved in such a sick act,” she added.
  Teo also urged parents to keep a close watch by educating their children on the proper and safe use of the internet, particularly social media apps.
  “Since January this year, MCMC has carried out the Safe Internet Campaign to educate the public, in particular our children, on the proper ways of using the internet.
  “This also covers cyberbullying as well as not communicating with any strangers on any social media platforms as a way to protect them from any harm,” she added.
  Teo said that since implementing the campaign, MCMC has successfully reached out to more than 11,000 students, ranging from primary to university level, as well as parents and teachers.
  She added that schools interested in holding the campaign for their students were encouraged to contact MCMC, where a trainer would be sent to conduct the program.
  Recently, a social media influencer lodged a police report after discovering a Facebook group that posted, among other things, pictures of her younger self.

直落平民华小创校于1920年，至今已走过105个年头，是瓜冷县首间华小，而且也是直落彭里玛加弄唯一华小。
十多年前，一名早已毕业多年的校友，因孩子入学而再度踏入熟悉的校园，也由此重新与母校牵起不解之缘。
起初担任家教协会副主席的他，积极地参与校务；后来更相继出任家协主席、董事，并在担任副董事长期间，因时任董事长健康欠佳而提早卸任，他毫不犹豫地挺身而出，勇于承担，接下领导重任。
ADVERTISEMENT
这名热心又具使命感的校友，正是
瓜冷县直落平民华小
现任董事长——
郑尚文
。
郑尚文：我希望在任期内，能完成综合大楼计划，推动母校迈向更现代化、系统化的发展，吸引更多学生就读。
自2009年担任董事长至今，郑尚文一路风雨相伴，携手母校稳步向前；尤其上任首年就带领董事部成功举办建校筹款晚宴，为学校发展奠定稳固的基础。
多年来，他始终秉持“团结协作，共谋发展”的理念，积极凝聚校方、家协与校友会三方力量，协调推进学校软硬体建设，让直落平民华小在和谐中持续成长。
个性亲切、言谈风趣的郑尚文，视教师与教职员如家人，不仅给予校方高度的信任与自主空间，也格外重视教职员的福利与教学环境，努力营造一个温暖有爱的校园大家庭。
郑尚文与教师关系融洽，宛如大家庭。
上任首年 筹款逐步提升设施
土生土长的郑尚文接受《校园我董》专访时表示，他于1979年毕业于直落平民华小；后来在2000年因孩子就读该校，开始投身学校事务，先后担任家协副主席及主席。
2010年，他加入董事部，2015年升任副董事长，并于2019年正式接棒出任董事长。
作为大家长的郑尚文（右一），一有时间就会到学校走走，关心学校状况。
他回忆道，学校原本于2018年筹划一项建校募款活动，但董事长在隔年因健康问题卸任，他担起了董事长责任。上任首年接手领导，并成功举办筹建一栋综合大楼的筹款活动，筹获430万令吉，超越原定目标350万令吉。
“其实我在2015年就曾担任筹委会主席，当时负责重建食堂与会议室，并成功筹得46万令吉。这段经验为我后来的工作打下了良好基础。”
郑尚文指出，该校也于2022年成功将旧篮球场，搬到校舍旁的新篮球场；旧篮球场腾出的空地后，也将规划兴建综合大楼。
他说，由于现有校舍课室不足，该校目前正积极筹备兴建一栋新综合大楼，增设行政办公室及特别课室。
“如今，正等待政府批准，期盼明年能动工，3年内能竣工，尽快让学生享有更完善的学习空间。”
他希望，在任期内完成这项工程，推动母校迈向更现代化、系统化的发展阶段。
校方邀请到曾任国家羽毛球队教练，也是校友的陈斌生回到母校，与学弟学妹分享羽球经历。
校舍基设须维修与提升
直落平民华小创校于1920年，至今已走过105个年头，是瓜冷县首间华小，并且也是直落彭里玛加弄唯一华小。
学校占地约1.82英亩，是全津贴华小，设有学前教育班，现在学生人数为332人。
郑尚文指出，由于校舍历史悠久，许多基本设施都需要维修与提升，这方面除了依靠政府拨款，也需要社会各界的关注与支持，让孩子能在更优质的环境中安心求学。
他期望综合大楼完工后，学校设施更臻完善，也能吸引更多家长把孩子送来就读，壮大校务发展。
腾出的空地将规划兴建一栋综合大楼，以增设更多特别课室和行政办公室。
学校占地约1.82英亩，是全津贴华小，设有学前教育班；现在学生人数为332人。
直落平民华小设有学前教育班。
不干预教学 却是学校最强后盾
作为学校的“大家长”，郑尚文总是站在第一线，无论是校方面临挑战，抑或教师遭遇误解或质疑，他都会挺身而出，成为学校最坚实的后盾。
“我对校方是百分百信任，从不干预教学事务，只有在必要时才从旁给予意见或协助。”
他说，教师如有任何疑问或难题，都能随时致电联络他寻求帮助。
他深信，彼此能共事是一种缘分，唯有互信、互助，才能让校务能正面发展。
郑尚文（右四）积极参与学校各项活动。
重建后的食堂和会议室，设有白钢桌椅，环境非常舒适。
直落平民华小的有盖篮球场设施非常完善和现代化。
有盖多元用途空间，可让校方进行周会，并成为学生课外活动空间。
郑尚文（中）与黄伂夤（右）及罗秋宁（左），在行政办公室前合影。
黄伂夤 罗秋宁：有董事长在 办活动不忧经费
陪同受访的校长黄伂夤及副校长罗秋宁异口同声表示，郑尚文是极具担当的董事长，是三机构之间的协调核心与稳定力量。
“我们举办校内外活动，从不为经费担忧，董事部都会积极协助；他不但主动争取各方资源，也非常关心教师福祉。”
她们说，董事长关心的不只是学校发展，也关注学生纪律与品格，期盼直落平民的学子都能成为品学兼优的新世代。

The fight against soaring food prices has become a top economic task for the newly launched Lee Jae-myung administration. —AP

JUST days into his presidency, South Korean leader Lee Jae-myung found himself facing an unlikely but potent symbol of economic distress: the cost of ramyeon. “Is it true,” he asked during an emergency economic meeting on Monday, “that one packet now costs 2,000 won (RM6.20)?”
The figure was exaggerated, but the sentiment behind the question struck a nerve. For many South Koreans, the supermarket has become the front line in a broader struggle over living costs and public trust in government.

加影市中心占地46.30公顷的地区已列入特别区域规划研究范围内。
（加影15日讯）加影市中心占地46.30公顷的地区已列入
特别区域规划研究
（RKK）范围内，拟通过该项特别计划，以在未来把加影打造为
文化遗产
城市
和
艺术中心
。
已圈定的研究地点主要在加影老街区，包括加影体育馆、体育馆捷运站、邮政局、警察局、免打粦街、苏莱曼街、拉惹哈仑街、敦阿都阿兹街、流古路部分地区、武吉路第10区、加影巴刹、加影士毛月路美景坊附近的蚬壳油站（SHELL）。
ADVERTISEMENT
根据资料，占地46.30公顷的研究区域，其中45.05公顷（97.34%）的土地已发展，未发展的土地仅剩1.23公顷（2.66%）。
加影邮政局是其中一间遗产建筑物，装修时还保留历史特色。
加影大街的老店屋以双层店为主。
28周将完成规划草案
研究区域现有的土地应用是房屋占1.03公顷（2.23%）、商业15.26公顷（32.97%）、商业-特用0.53公顷（1.15%）、空地2.08公顷（4.49%）、绿肺1.74公顷（3.77%）、教育1.98公顷（4.28%）、安全1.49公顷（3.22%）、宗教0.54公顷（1.17%）、基本设施及公用设施0.42公顷（0.91%）、交通19.98公顷（43.15%）、雪州水务管理公司1.23公顷（2.66%）。
上述计划是由房屋及地方政府部城市及乡区规划局（PLAN Malaysia）进行，顾问公司负责研究工作，加影是其中一个被遴选的地区。该项研究计划已在第12大马计划第五“滚动计划” 获批，并于2025年实施，拨款是65万令吉。
相关单位和负责团队已在4月份的加影市议会常月会议上作出汇报，顾问公司将在28周内进行和完成规划草案，并于9月23日提呈执行摘要报告给有关当局。
研究范围涵盖重新复兴和美化加影市中心的发展和管理蓝图，以紧密、全盘、精明和持久的方式将加影市中心打造为文化遗产城市和艺术中心。
加影市中心交通便利，靠近公共交通网如加影体育馆捷运站。
遗产建筑物111间 分布在4条街
加影市中心现有的遗产建筑物分布在加影杜更街、苏莱曼街、大街和免打粦街，共有111间。
加影大街的老店屋最多，共有49间，其次是免打粦街29间、苏莱曼街23间、杜更街10间；有关的建筑结构含有老式店屋风格、混搭风（Gaya Eklektik）、新古典主义风格（Gaya Neoklasik）的特色。
加影免打粦街是加影老街道之一。
根据调查报告，加影市中心虽然面对基本设施和民生问题，但交通便利、靠近公共交通网如加影体育馆捷运站的加影市中心有潜能发展为遗产和艺术中心。
报告说，虽然如此，加影市中心的遗产产业需获得修复和保存，提升形象和特色，并把加影市中心打造为遗产和文化的旅游目的地。除此，多样化的经济活动，可以为当地及周边居民提供就业机会。
根据报告，研究区域面对的问题包括加影市中心缺乏宜居的影响力；重新发展或更换建筑物用途面对发展的压力；需要准备交通管理和交通蓝图；遗产形象不清晰及需要准备遗产建筑物清单；缺乏社区活动空间。
另外的问题是建筑物业主或业者与执行单位缺乏合作、商业及社区被安全课题困扰、加影巴刹需提升或搬迁、当进入加影市中心，没有欢迎的感觉、冷岳河河水倒溢导致研究区域发生闪电水灾及研究区域停车位缺乏引发交通堵塞。
王声宾：规划加影市中心未来发展的蓝图，并探讨往文化遗产城市和艺术中心方向前进。
王声宾（加影市议员）：要让加影更有活力
“这是一份规划加影市中心未来发展的蓝图，并探讨往文化遗产城市和艺术中心这个方向前进，日后，加影市议会将按照该规划执行。
顾问公司正进行收集资料、访问的工作，且会召开一项涉及华团、商家和小贩等的各项会议，以搜集各方面的意见。
蓝图敲定后，加影市议会才能够向相关部门申请来发展，假设是文化遗产，会做些什么东西？如何提升？都需按照篮图的需要来申请拨款。
加影在早年有‘文化城’之称，怎样让这个社区有活力，老店可以做些什么，若是文化旅游发展，就要有生产力及提供更多的经济机会和就业机会，这些都是需要去探讨的。
老加影人迁移至花园住宅区后，加影街上已没有人居住，如何改善加影市中心的生活素质模式也是重要的一环。
在地理位置上，加影是一个相当优势的城市，有好的交通系统，交通便利，也有捷运站的设立。
林金瑛：希望把加影市中心打造为文化街。
林金瑛（加影市议员）：战前建筑物是文化符号
“把加影打造为文化遗产城市是前2任加影州议员努力去进行，包括已故州议员李成金在任期间积极推动该计划，后来在许来贤担任加影州议员时，也努力推动该计划。
由于面对资金问题，该计划难以进行，过后又因行管令，导致该计划延迟，这次加影终于被遴选，加影和其他城市如太平、芙蓉等地一样，都有这样的潜能。
加影市中心还保留不少的老建筑物和战前建筑物，这些都是文化特征，我们希望把加影市中心打造为文化街，这也是李成金早年的概念，希望被接纳。
无论如何，在发展的同时，加影市中心的停车位需被保留，一个街区若停车位不足够，将影响一个地区的发展。”
古色古香的加影镇方寺。
加影杜更街老店屋的建筑结构是混搭风为主。
加影杜更街的老店屋窗口还保留古典风格。
虽然面对交通堵塞和基本设施等问题，但加影市中心有潜能发展为文化遗产城市和艺术中心。
加影大街交通繁忙，也是拥有最多老店屋的街道。

WorldStarmer U-turn: UK launches national inquiry into decades-long child-sex abuse scandal involving ‘grooming gangs’

OTTAWA, June 15 — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer yesterday announced a national inquiry focused into a UK child-sex scandal that attracted the attention of US billionaire Elon Musk.
Starmer had previously resisted calls for an inquiry into the so-called “grooming gangs” in favour of a series of local probes.
But speaking to British reporters travelling with him to Canada, Starmer said his position on the issue had changed and he would accept the recommendation in an independent report into child sexual exploitation.
“I have never said we should not look again at any issue. That’s why I asked Louise Casey who I hugely respect to do an audit,” he said referring to a member of the upper house of parliament.
“Her position when she started the audit was that there was not a real need for a national inquiry.... She has looked at the material she has looked at and she has come to the view that there should be a national inquiry,” he added.
The scandal was over the exploitation of thousands of girls and young women over several decades in towns across England.
Gangs of men, often from Pakistani backgrounds, targeted mostly white girls from disadvantaged backgrounds, some of whom lived in children’s homes.
The gangs operated in several English towns and cities, notably in Rotherham and Rochdale in the north, but also in Oxford and Bristol, for almost four decades.
The issue of UK grooming gangs was thrust into the international spotlight in January when tech billionaire Elon Musk in January launched incendiary attacks on his X platform against the UK government for resisting the calls for a national inquiry. — AFP

SINGAPORE, June 15 — Swaying to dance music and TikTok-fuelled pop under a disco ball, young punters are packed shoulder to shoulder while sipping on coffee, their energy powered by pour-overs rather than pints.
  This is no underground rave, nor a brunch gone wild. It’s a caffeine-powered daytime clubbing sesh — part of a growing wave of alcohol-free, Gen Z-driven events gaining traction in Singapore and elsewhere in the world.
  At a recent event in Singapore’s trendy Duxton district, the space was jammed by 4:00 pm, with baristas churning out fancy coffees and DJs spinning back-to-back sets.
  The crowd grooved with energy, even without the usual liquid courage.
  “A lot of people think alcohol gives you the high, but caffeine sometimes can do that too,” said Aden Low, 21, co-founder of Beans and Beats which organises coffee raves at different venues.
  “That’s why the atmosphere at our events tends to be quite energetic.”
  The parties blend curated music with specialty coffee served in white paper cups.

  The vibe is light, friendly and very Gen Z.
  “It’s also the idea that this is a safe space,” said Esther Low, 31, who was at the event in Duxton.
  “When you go to a club setting, there’s usually this underlying intention to hook up. So, for me, that’s personally why I would prefer this.”
  Several reports say Gen Z is chugging fewer pints than previous generations, with the sober curious movement gaining popularity on social media.
  Sober curious people cut back on drinking or abstain altogether, often citing health reasons and better mental acuity.
  “Changes in alcohol use have been observed in population surveys and cohort studies. Generally, alcohol use among young adults has decreased,” the World Health Organisation said in a 2024 report.

  From London to Los Angeles and Melbourne, similar coffee raves have swept up the social scene, appealing to young partygoers who also want to avoid hangovers.
  Ashley Chean, a Singaporean student who has been alcohol-free for a year, said she appreciates these sober gatherings.
  “When I lived in Paris, I realised I had a lot of alcoholic tendencies and I didn’t want that to be my lifestyle,” the 20-year-old told AFP.
  “More and more of my friends are sober or sober curious.”
  The coffee clubbing events are usually held in cafes and other spaces such as rooftop bars — as long as there’s room for DJs and baristas to do their thing while people dance.

  The parties typically end by late afternoon, just in time for golden hour selfies.
  Besides the health benefits of avoiding alcohol, the events appeal to cost-conscious youth in Singapore, one of the most expensive cities in the world.
  The excess drinking and hard-partying ways of Gen X — fuelled by anthems like the Beastie Boys’ “Fight for Your Right (to Party)” and hip-hop videos glamorising club culture — are fading for members of Gen Z.
  While organisers don’t see Singapore’s glitzy nightlife and clubbing being replaced, they hope their combination of beats and brews will keep the dance floor buzzing.
  “As long as we bring the vibes, we’ll be OK,” said Ashley. — AFP

KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): The ringgit is expected to trade within a narrow range from Monday onwards (June 16 ), as investors remain cautious amid ongoing global inflation concerns, said an analyst.
  Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid noted that the local currency is likely to fluctuate between 4.22 and 4.24 against the US dollar.
  He added that market attention will be on the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on June 17-18.
  "The focus would be on the quarterly forecast by the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) staff, particularly the outlook for the Fed Funds Rate for the remainder of the year,” he told Bernama.
  Mohd Afzanizam said besides the Fed, several central banks are set to meet next week, including the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, the People's Bank of China. Central banks in the ASEAN region, such as the Bank of Indonesia and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will also hold meetings during this period.
  Generally, he opined that global interest rates are trending downward as global growth prospects have become more challenging due to tariff shocks.
  Meanwhile, he said Israel’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities resulted in a sharp rise in Brent crude prices to a high of US$78.22 per barrel before prices retreated towards US$73.56 per barrel. The US Dollar Index gained 0.31 per cent to 98.228 points.
  "Hence, geopolitics has taken centre stage on Friday, and it has benefitted the US dollar at the moment,” he said.
  Reports suggested that a direct military conflict between Israel and Iran could lead to a significant appreciation of the US dollar. The Fed’s response to these dynamics, particularly regarding interest rates, will be crucial in shaping the US dollar's trajectory in the near term.
  For the week just ended, the ringgit gave up its earlier gains as escalating geopolitical concerns spurred demand for the safe-haven US dollar.
  The ringgit ended the week easier against the greenback, closing at 4.2435/2480 on Friday from 4.2270/2360 a week earlier.
  The local note traded lower against a basket of major currencies.
  The ringgit fell vis-à-vis the Japanese yen to 2.9448/9482 from 2.9324/9390 at Friday’s close, slipped against the British pound to 5.7482/7543 from 5.7212/7334 previously, and depreciated versus the euro to 4.8906/8958 from 4.8268/8371 at the end of last week.
  The ringgit traded mostly lower against ASEAN currencies.
  The local note declined against the Singapore dollar to 3.3077/3118 on Friday from 3.2862/2934 in the previous week, weakened versus the Indonesian rupiah to 260.2/260.6 from 259.5/260.2 previously, and slid versus the Thai baht to 13.0807/1018 from 12.9599/9947 last week.
  Meanwhile, the ringgit remained unchanged against the Philippine peso at 7.55/7.56. - Bernama

Spotted near Mount Everest: Global warming might be leading venomous snakes to adapt and settle in higher altitudes, experts say. — SUBODH ACHARYA/The Kathmandu Post/ANN

IN the past one and a half months, 10 highly venomous snakes typically found in warmer climates– nine King Cobras and a Monocled Cobra – have been rescued from various locations in the Kathmandu Valley.
Both the snake species, common in Tarai districts, especially in the summer season, have now started to appear in the supposedly cooler hilly and mountainous areas as well.

（纽约15日综合电）印第安那溜马可谓已错失了争冠的最好机会，反观常规赛老大奥克拉荷马雷霆可说是渡过了最危险的状况，天王山之战（第5战）将非常关键！
赛前并不被看好的溜马在美国
NBA
总决赛第3战于主场取胜后，一度取得2比1总比分领先，据美国运动预测网站分析，当时其夺冠机率提升至40%以上。

溜马没把握好第4战局势
第4战继续主场作战，溜马一度于第3节末领先10分，看来有望在7战4胜制的总决赛取得3比1“听牌”优势。
然而，雷霆在“SGA”亚历山大在末节挺身而出，打出31比17攻势，将总比分扳成2比2。
目前，双方人马仍保持在平手局面，将回到雷霆主场打第5战。

溜马老帅盼球队强势回归
溜马在该赢未赢后，夜长梦多，且夺冠机率仅剩下20%；根据历史数据分析，过去在季后赛落入1比3的情况下，只有不到5%的球队能够笑到最后。
溜马全队团结一致严阵以待，老帅卡莱尔盼球队强势回归，“我们必须严阵以待，全力以赴强势回归。第4战令人失望，所幸还有3场比赛。我们必须重振旗鼓。我不需要激励这些球员。面对这种挑战，大起大落在所难免。现在处于低潮，我们必须东山再起。”
拿下天王山战胜率将超8成
天王山之战赢球的队伍，有84%的球队最终能够顺利赢下系列赛，哈利伯顿称，溜马全队会做好准备。“我们必须做好准备迎接第5战，进入敌军主场。我们还有几天可以沉淀下，我很期待接下来的挑战。”
哈利伯顿仍对接下来的系列赛抱持信心，“球队必须做好反击的准备。当陷入绝境时，我们必须做出回应。”
队友兼东决MVP西亚卡姆则说：“我们之前在客场赢过一些比赛。我们只需要带著信心上场，我认为我们有能力办到。”

此役是霍华德职业生涯最后一季的开端，他曾表示希望以今季作为告别。但他在上场不久后，就因为与兰斯·史蒂芬森爆发肢体冲突而成为焦点。
火箭与水行侠续约3年
据《ESPN》名记查拉尼亚报道，火箭与替补中锋“水行侠”亚当斯达成3年3900万美元续约，新赛季将续留火箭效力。这笔交易成交后也代表自由市场上少了一名即战力且征战经验丰富的中锋。

KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): Bursa Malaysia’s key index is set to move between 1,500 and 1,530 nthis week, as markets remain under pressure amid concerns over Washington’s planned unilateral tariff letters and escalating tensions following Israel’s strike on Iran.
  UOB Kay Hian Wealth Advisors Sdn Bhd’s head of investment research Mohd Sedek Jantan said markets are expected to remain vulnerable and trade lower in the near term, unless a meaningful breakthrough occurs over the weekend to de-escalate the conflict, an outcome he said appears unlikely.
  "From a tactical standpoint, oil and gas (O&G) stocks may present short-term trading opportunities, particularly those with upstream exposure or companies expanding their upstream concessions, as they stand to benefit directly from the current rally in oil prices,” he told Bernama.
  Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd equity research vice-president Thong Pak Leng said market participants are advised to closely monitor ongoing geopolitical tensions and any developments related to US President Donald Trump’s stance on US-China trade tariffs.
  "We also believe the rise in crude oil prices could present opportunities for investors to explore O&G and commodity related stocks. We anticipate the benchmark index to trend within the 1,500-1,530 range, representing its support and resistance levels,” he added.
  Thong noted that if tensions continue to escalate, the second support level is projected at 1,485.
  For the week just ended, Bursa Malaysia kicked off in positive territory at the beginning of the week, driven by positive developments in the US-China trade negotiations, stocks accumulation by local institutions, and a slowdown in foreign selling activity.
  On a Friday-to-Friday basis, the barometer index rose 1.32 points to 1,518.11 from 1,516.79 a week earlier.
  The FBM Emas Index gained 14.84 points to 11,370.18, the FBMT 100 Index added 20.35 points to 11,144.04, and the FBM Emas Shariah Index climbed 0.31 of-a-point to 11,329.53. 
  The FBM 70 Index increased 72.14 points to 16,368.71 while the FBM ACE Index fell 32.13 points to 4,487.19.
  Across sectors, the Industrial Products and Services Index was 0.55 of-a-point higher at 151.35 and the Energy Index gained 22.31 points to 740.76.
  The Plantation Index slid 31.93 points to 7,220.92, the Healthcare Index drooped 16.42 points to 1,777.72,  and the Financial Services Index tumbled 60.06 points to 17,648.25.
  Turnover surged to 13.89 billion units worth RM10.61 billion from 9.80 billion units worth RM8.18 billion in the preceding week.
  The Main Market volume jumped to 6.42 billion units valued at RM9.47 billion against 4.50 billion units valued at RM7.21 billion previously.
  Warrants turnover expanded to 5.97 billion units worth RM687.92 million versus 4.07 billion units worth RM533.43 million a week ago.
  The ACE Market volume improved to 1.50 billion units valued at RM458.75 million compared with 1.22 billion units valued at RM432.22 million in the preceding week. - Bernama

KANGAR, June 15 (Bernama) -- Unity among people of different races, religions, and ethnicities is a vital asset and a central pillar in achieving the formation of a MADANI society and nation, which the government is currently pursuing, said the Raja of Perlis, Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Jamalullail.
  His Royal Highness said that since unity is the key to the success and well-being of the people, continuous efforts must be made by all levels of society.
  “Everyone must realise their role and responsibility in contributing to the strengthening of unity and values.
  “Unity is not the responsibility of a single party. It requires a collective effort from government agencies, non-governmental organisations, community leaders, educational institutions, and every individual. We all have a part to play.
  “Let us make our homes, schools, workplaces, and communities’ platforms to nurture the spirit of unity and love among people,” His Royal Highness said at the official opening of this year’s state-level Unity Week celebration here today.
  Gracing the event was Raja Perempuan of Perlis, Tuanku Tengku Fauziah Almarhum Tengku Abdul Rashid. 
  Raja Muda of Perlis, Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra Jamalullail, Raja Puan Muda of Perlis, Tuanku Dr Hajah Lailatul Shahreen Akashah Khalil and  Deputy Minister of National Unity, Senator Saraswathy Kandasami were also in attendance.
  Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin stated that the challenges to unity have become increasingly complex, ranging from issues of racism to extremist ideologies, emphasising that initiatives like Unity Week should serve as a platform to strengthen inter-ethnic interaction, broaden community networks, and foster understanding among communities.
  “Therefore, I hope that this programme will achieve its goals by ensuring that the element of unity becomes the foundation in every action and interaction, based on mutual respect, cooperation, consensus, and tolerance,” the Ruler said.
  Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin also urged the people of Perlis, regardless of their background, to continue supporting this noble effort to ensure the continuity of harmony and stability in the state and the nation.
